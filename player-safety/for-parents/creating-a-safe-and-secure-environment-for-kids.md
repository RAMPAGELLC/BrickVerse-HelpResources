# Creating a Safe and Secure Environment for Kids

At BrickVerse.co, we are committed to providing a fun and secure multiplayer online platform for children, teens, and young adults to create and play games. To ensure the safety of our younger audience and comply with COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) regulations, we have implemented a system where users under the age of 13 cannot create accounts directly. Instead, their parent or legal guardian must create a parent account and an account on their child's behalf. In this article, we will guide you through this process and explain how the parent account works.

### Why Parent Accounts for Users Under 13?

Our decision to require parent accounts for users under the age of 13 is driven by our commitment to safeguarding the privacy and safety of children online. COPPA regulations require us to obtain parental consent for children under 13, and our parent account system helps us comply with these important guidelines.

### Creating a Parent Account

1. **Visit BrickVerse.co:** Go to our website at [www.BrickVerse.co](http://www.brickverse.co/).
2. **Click on "Sign Up":** On the homepage, click on the "Sign Up" button.
3. **Choose "Parent Account":** Select the "Parent Account" option.
4. **Fill Out Parent Information:** Provide your name, email address, and create a password.
5. **Verify Your Email:** Check your email inbox for a verification link and click on it to confirm your parent account.
6. **Add Your Child's Account:**
   * After verifying your email, log in to your parent account.
   * You will have the option to add a child's account.
   * Enter your child's name, date of birth, and create a username and password for them.

### Managing Your Child's Account

As a parent or legal guardian, you have control over your child's account through your parent account. Here's what you can do:

1. **Password Reset:** If your child forgets their password, you can reset it through your parent account.
2. **Approval of Actions:** You have the ability to approve or deny specific actions taken by your child on BrickVerse.co. This helps you monitor their online activity and ensure it aligns with your family's guidelines.
3. **Set Restrictions:** You can set age-appropriate restrictions on your child's account to limit access to certain features or content that may not be suitable for their age.
4. **Monitor Activity:** Keep an eye on your child's activity within the platform to ensure they have a safe and enjoyable experience.

### Privacy and Security

BrickVerse.co takes privacy and security seriously. We do not collect unnecessary personal information from your child, and we will never share their data without your consent. Your child's safety is our top priority, and our platform is designed to provide a positive and secure gaming experience.
