# Ensuring a Safe and Secure Online Environment

At BrickVerse.co, the safety and well-being of our young audience are our top priorities. We are committed to providing a fun and secure multiplayer online platform for children, teens, and young adults to create and play games. To maintain a safe community, we have implemented a Government Identification Verification system. In this article, we will explain why this system is in place and how it works.

### Why Government Identification Verification?

The primary purpose of our Government Identification Verification system is to ensure the safety and protection of our younger users. Unfortunately, the internet is not always a safe space, and we want to create a welcoming environment free from abuse and harassment. By verifying the identity of users aged 21 and older, we can significantly reduce the risk of dangerous individuals targeting our community.

### How Does Government Identification Verification Work?

1. **Age Verification:** When users register on BrickVerse.co, they will be asked to provide their date of birth. If the provided date of birth indicates that they are 21 years or older, they will be prompted to go through the Government Identification Verification process.
2. **Secure Document Upload:** To complete the verification process, users will need to upload a government-issued identification document, such as a driver's license or passport. We take user privacy seriously, and these documents will be securely stored and used only for verification purposes.
3. **Manual Review:** Our dedicated team will review the uploaded documents to verify the user's age. We will not store any personal information beyond what is necessary for this verification process.
4. **Approved Users:** Once the verification is successful, users aged 21 and older will gain full access to the platform. They can create games, interact with the community, and enjoy all the features BrickVerse.co has to offer.

### Protecting the Younger Audience

By implementing Government Identification Verification for users aged 21 and older, we can maintain a safer environment for our younger users. This system helps us ensure that individuals with harmful intentions are not able to access the platform and potentially harm our community.

### Privacy and Data Security

BrickVerse.co takes privacy and data security seriously. We will only use the information provided during the verification process for the sole purpose of age verification. Rest assured, your personal information will be handled with the utmost care and stored securely.

### Conclusion

At BrickVerse.co, our mission is to provide a fun and secure online space for children, teens, and young adults to create and play games. Our Government Identification Verification system is a crucial step in achieving this goal, as it helps us protect our community from potentially dangerous users.
