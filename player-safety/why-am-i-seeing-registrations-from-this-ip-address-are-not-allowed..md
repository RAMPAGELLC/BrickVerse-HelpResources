# Why am I seeing “Registrations from this IP address are not allowed.”?

If you receive this message while trying to create a BrickVerse account, it means our system has temporarily blocked new registrations from your current internet connection (IP address).

This doesn’t always mean **you** did something wrong — but it does mean the IP you’re using has been linked to activity that violated our rules.

***

### 🚫 Why this happens

BrickVerse uses automated and manual security systems to protect the platform from abuse. Your IP address may be restricted from registering new accounts for one of the following reasons:

#### 1. **Connection to a banned or suspended account**

Your IP address was recently used by an account that was:

* Permanently banned
* Temporarily suspended
* Involved in serious rule violations (scams, exploits, harassment, etc.)

To prevent repeat abuse, new registrations from that same connection may be blocked.

***

#### 2. **Repeated rule-breaking from the same network**

If multiple accounts created from the same IP were banned in a short time, the system may automatically restrict further sign-ups from that network.

This commonly happens with:

* Shared households where someone previously broke the rules
* School or public networks
* VPN or proxy services used by many people

***

#### 3. **Use of VPNs, proxies, or anonymizers**

Some VPN and proxy IP ranges are flagged because they are frequently used to:

* Evade bans
* Create spam accounts
* Abuse platform systems

If you are using a VPN, try turning it off and registering again using your normal home connection.

***

#### 4. **Public or shared internet connections**

If you’re on:

* School Wi-Fi
* Library or café internet
* Apartment or dorm shared networks

Another person on that same network may have violated BrickVerse rules, which can cause the entire IP to be restricted.

***

### ✅ What you can do

#### ✔ Try switching networks

If possible, attempt registration using:

* Your home internet (without a VPN)
* Mobile data (cellular hotspot)

Sometimes simply changing networks resolves the issue immediately.

***

#### ✔ Restart your router (home users)

Some internet providers assign **dynamic IP addresses**. Restarting your modem/router may give you a new IP that is not restricted.

***

#### ✔ Contact BrickVerse Support

If you believe this restriction is a mistake, you can appeal.

When contacting support, include:

* The exact error message
* Your approximate location (country/state only — no exact address)
* Whether you’re on home, school, work, or public Wi-Fi
* Confirmation that you are not trying to bypass a previous ban

This helps us review your case faster.

***

### ❗ Important to know

* This block only affects **new account registrations**
* Existing accounts can still log in normally (unless separately restricted)
* Attempting to bypass this system to avoid a ban may result in further enforcement

***

### Still stuck?

If you continue seeing this error after trying a different network, please reach out to BrickVerse Support so we can investigate and help you get started safely.

We appreciate your patience — these protections help keep BrickVerse fun and fair for everyone.
