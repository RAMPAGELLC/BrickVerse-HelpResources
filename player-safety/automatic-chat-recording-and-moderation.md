#### Automatic Chat Recording & Moderation

One of the key features of BrickVerse is our automatic chat recording and moderation system. This ensures a safe and enjoyable environment for all users, allowing them to communicate and collaborate without concerns about inappropriate content or privacy breaches.

**How it Works**

1. **Real-time Monitoring:** BrickVerse automatically monitors in-game chat messages in real-time.
2. **Recording to Moderation Database:** All chat messages are recorded to our moderation database, creating a comprehensive log of interactions within the platform.
3. **Content Filtering:** Our system automatically filters chat messages for potentially harmful content, such as sharing personal information (e.g., IP Addresses) or using inappropriate language.

**Moderation Actions**

To maintain a positive and secure community, BrickVerse employs a tiered system of moderation actions for repeated violations:

1. **Warnings:** Users receive warnings for minor infractions, reminding them of the community guidelines.
2. **Temporary Bans:** In cases of more severe violations, users may face temporary bans to deter further misconduct.
3. **Permanent Bans:** Continuous disregard for community guidelines may result in permanent bans to protect the community from harmful behavior.
