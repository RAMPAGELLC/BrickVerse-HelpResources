# My account was hacked - What do I do?

Losing an account can be scary. Don't worry â€” we're here to help! Follow the steps below.

## Account Damage Control

1.  **Remove Off-site Downloads or Browser Extensions**\


    Before proceeding with account recovery, it is essential to eliminate any malware that might compromise your security. In the event that you have unintentionally downloaded content from an untrustworthy website, it could potentially expose your account to further threats. To address this, it is recommended to conduct a comprehensive virus scan on your computer to identify and remove any harmful files or programs. After completing the scan, it is advisable to restart your computer and perform an additional scan for an added layer of precaution.&#x20;



    Additionally, it is crucial to uninstall any browser extensions that may have been installed. It is best to exclusively use extensions from reputable and verified sources to ensure their safety and legitimacy. By taking these precautionary measures, you can significantly reduce the risk of compromising your account's security and enhance your overall online safety.
2.  **Reset Your Password**

    Change your account's password to something that is secure and isn't easy to guess.&#x20;
3.  **Enable Two Step Verification**

    Enabling two step verification can provide a great length of security to your account.
