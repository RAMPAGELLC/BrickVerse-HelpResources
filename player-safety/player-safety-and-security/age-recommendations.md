# Age Recommendations

BrickVerse's age recommendations were created so all users can make informed decisions about the content they interact with. To determine the suitability of content for each age category, we examined global industry standards and consulted child development experts to guide our policy making.&#x20;

Content rated 13+ will be locked based on a accounts age.

Here are our age categories:

### All Ages

Content is generally suitable for all ages. May contain infrequent mild violence and/or light unrealistic blood.

### 9+

Content is generally suitable for ages 9 and up. May contain frequent mild violence and/or heavy unrealistic blood.

### 13+

Content is generally suitable for ages 13 and up. May contain frequent moderate violence and/or light realistic blood.

### 15+

Content is generally suitable for ages 15 and up. May contain frequent moderate violence and/or realistic blood, and moderate profanity.

### 18+

Content is generally suitable for ages 18 and up. May contain frequent moderate violence and/or realistic blood, profanity, gambling, and alcohol reference.

## Content Filtering

Users aged 12 and below will have their messages & content they view from others automatically filtered for profanity, revealing information such as real name, phone number, etc. This is known as heavy filtering.

Users aged 13+ have moderate filtering on the site to prevent adult content, harassment, hate speech, etc.
