# Age Ratings & Content Descriptors on BrickVerse

To keep BrickVerse safe and transparent for everyone, all experiences must complete an **Age Rating & Content Descriptor Questionnaire** before they can be published.

This process is **required** for every game on the platform.

***

### Why Age Ratings Matter

Age ratings help ensure that players are only able to access experiences appropriate for their age.

When you complete the Rating Questionnaire, BrickVerse automatically assigns an age rating based on the content in your game.

If your game exceeds the allowed content for certain age groups, it will be restricted accordingly.

**Example:**

* A game that contains strong language (swearing) may receive a **17+** rating.
* Only users aged 17 and older will be able to play it.
* Younger users will not see or access the experience.

This helps protect younger players and ensures compliance with platform safety standards.

***

### Available Age Ratings

Every experience will receive one of the following ratings:

* **Unrated**
* **All Ages**
* **Age 9+**
* **Age 13+**
* **Age 17+**

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Unrated experiences cannot be played by anyone except the developers.**\
Your game must complete the Rating Questionnaire to become playable by the public.

### What Are Content Descriptors?

Content descriptors provide clear information about what appears in your experience. These appear alongside the age rating and help players and parents make informed decisions.

Examples of content descriptors include:

* Scary Content
* Blood
* Violence
* Strong Language
* AI Interaction

Descriptors do not automatically mean your game will receive a high age rating, but certain combinations or severity levels may increase the rating.

### Developer Requirements

Before publishing:

1. Complete the **BrickVerse Rating Questionnaire**.
2. Accurately disclose all relevant content.
3. Submit for automated age classification.
4. Ensure the rating is assigned before publishing.

Failure to accurately disclose content may result in:

* Experience moderation
* Rating adjustments
* Temporary suspension of publishing privileges

### Best Practices for Developers

* Be honest and thorough when answering rating questions.
* Consider all gameplay elements, dialogue, audio, and visuals.
* Re-submit the questionnaire if you update your game with new content.
* When in doubt, disclose it.
