In order to maintain a high standard of conduct, we have implemented robust tools and systems to address any instances of rule-breaking or inappropriate behavior. If you come across any user who is violating our community guidelines, we encourage you to report them. By reporting such incidents, you play an active role in helping us enforce the rules and create a safer community for everyone.

When it comes to reporting users, we provide convenient options both in-game and on our website. In the game, you can utilize the built-in reporting feature, usually accessible through the settings or player menu. This allows you to quickly and efficiently report any incidents or individuals that you believe are engaging in inappropriate behavior. Our dedicated moderation team will review each report thoroughly and take appropriate action to address the situation.

Similarly, on our website, we have a user-friendly reporting system in place. You can navigate to the designated reporting section and provide details about the incident or user in question. We highly encourage you to provide as much information as possible, including screenshots or any supporting evidence, to help us better understand the situation. Rest assured that all reports are treated confidentially and handled with utmost professionalism.

By actively reporting users who violate our community guidelines, you contribute to the well-being of BrickVerse and help us maintain a positive and enjoyable environment for all.
