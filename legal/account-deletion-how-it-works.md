# Account Deletion – How It Works

At BrickVerse, we take account deletion seriously and apply the same secure deletion system whether your account is removed due to:

* A **GDPR data request**
* A **moderation action**
* A **user-initiated deletion request**

This article explains exactly what happens when an account is marked for deletion.

***

### Step 1: Account Marked for Deletion

Once your account is flagged for deletion:

* Your username is immediately changed to:\
  `deleted_youruserid`
* Your account is placed into a **5-day grace period queue**

This grace period exists in case:

* A moderation decision is reversed
* A deletion request is canceled
* A support escalation requires review

During this time, your account is considered inactive and pending removal. Your sessions will be signed out and you can no longer login.

***

### Step 2: 5-Day Grace Period

After the 5-day grace period ends, permanent deletion begins.

At this stage:

* Your **email address** is scrubbed from our systems
* **IP logs and related metadata** are permanently deleted
* Account permissions are fully reset
* Username history is cleared, allowing your old username to become available to others
* Forum posts, game likes, help tickets, and similar activity are removed immediately

***

### Virtual Currency (Cubes)

BrickVerse will:

* Seize any remaining **Cubes** (our virtual currency) from:
  * Your account
  * Any guilds you own

Cubes are permanently removed and cannot be recovered.

***

### Created Assets (Secondary Deletion System)

Assets you created — including:

* Universes
* Marketplace items
* Developer assets

— go through a **secondary deletion system**.

These items receive an **additional 5-day grace period** before being fully removed from:

* Our CDN (Content Delivery Network)
* Our databases

This ensures:

* Data integrity
* Proper system cleanup
* Final cancellation window if necessary

After this additional grace period, assets are permanently deleted.

***

### Transactions & Entitlements

Please note:

* **No refunds are issued** for any purchases.
* All entitlements (such as game passes and other digital unlocks) are revoked.
* Deleted accounts cannot be restored after final processing completes.

***

### Important Notes

* Once deletion fully completes, recovery is not possible.
* All deletion types (GDPR, moderation, user request) follow the same system.
* If you believe your account was incorrectly marked for deletion, contact support immediately during the 5-day grace period.
