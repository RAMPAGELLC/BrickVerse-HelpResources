Last Updated: October 25th, 2023

## Introduction

Welcome to BrickVerse, Our ultimate goal is to build a platform where users are safe, have fun, and can connect with their friends from around the world. In order to ensure that our goal is met, we have outlined and set out these terms of service (or "**Terms**"). We want to make sure you understand that this is a legally binding agreement between you, a user, and BrickVerse.gg. ("**Company**", "**we**", "**us**", "**our**", "**BrickVerse**", or "**BrickVerse.gg**").

It is the responsibility of you, or your parent/guardian to read the Terms of Service before proceeding to use the BrickVerse platform. If you for any reason disagree with the terms, policies, guidelines, etc you are prohibited from usage of the platform.

## Your agreement to the Terms of Services and rules bound in addition

The following document is an agreement between you, the other users of this platform and BrickVerse.&#x20;

All users of the site, including but not limited to the employees must agree and follow the Terms of Services while using the BrickVerse platform. In addition to the Terms of Services, you will also agree to additional terms outlined by the administration team of BrickVerse on other sections of the platform that bind to the Terms of Services.&#x20;

If you do not agree to the Terms of Service, then you are prohibited to not use our platform in any shape or form until acceptance of our Term's Of Service.

**By accepting the Terms Of Service you agree to** the Privacy Policy, Purchase Agreement, Refund Policy, Virtual Currency Policy, BrickVerse.gg Account and Billing Information Disclosure Policy, Digital Services Act - Information on Average Monthly Active Recipients in the European Union, Inactive account deletion policy, and other policy's & amendments created by BrickVerse.gg.

When BrickVerse releases amendments to Term's Of Service, Privacy Policy, new policy creation, etc. it's your duty to review these changes. If you disagree with new agreements you are to immediately cease usage of BrickVerse. We typically will put out a notice of the new changes, by E-mail, site banner, site and/or device notification, phone texts, etc.

## SMS Communication

BrickVerse's Link Phone feature is designed to facilitate communication among users within our virtual environment. It allows for text messaging/notifications, fostering connections and interactions. Users should be aware that while using this feature, any text messages sent through the Link Phone may be subject to standard text messaging fees, depending on their mobile service provider's terms and conditions. BrickVerse cannot be held responsible for any costs or fees related to text messaging, data usage, or any other charges incurred by users when utilizing the Link Phone feature.&#x20;

By using the Link Phone feature, users agree to release BrickVerse from any liability associated with phone text fees or any other financial obligations arising from its usage.&#x20;

Usage of Link Phone may incur charges requiring a Membership Plan. Monthly with your BrickVerse Membership plan you will be given a set limit of text messages. If you exceed that limit for the month, messages will no longer be sent till your plan is renewed again for the next month. You won't be charged anything, its included with membership pricing by default. We will let you know when this rolls out.

## Brand and Asset Usage

Our games hold significant importance to both our team and our dedicated community of players. Many members of our community share a deep passion for utilizing our Brands and in-game elements to create fantastic experiences. Nevertheless, there are instances when individuals cross boundaries, leading to actions that mislead our community into believing that certain products or services are officially connected to, endorsed by, or produced by us. Such situations are far from ideal, particularly when users fall victim to intentional exploitation, purchasing goods under the false pretense that they are official. These incidents, in essence, compromise our ability to maintain the quality of products and services, thereby undermining the trust we've cultivated within our community.

We're committed to fostering creativity and innovation among our community by allowing you to work with the content we provide on our Site. To facilitate this, we have established a set of guidelines to clarify what constitutes fair and unfair use of our Name, Brand, and Assets. These guidelines serve the purpose of providing transparency, outlining actions that don't require prior approval from us, as well as actions that necessitate contacting us to ensure compliance.

These guidelines encompass the use of our Brand and Assets, specifically referring to:

1. **Name:** This pertains to the name of any game, its associated features, events, company identity, and any names closely resembling our games, features, events, or company identity.
2. **Brand:** This includes the brand name and related logo, as well as the distinctive characteristics of our game names and features.
3. **Assets:** Assets refer to the code, software, graphics, textures, images, models, sound, audio, or content originating from our games, as well as any videos or screenshots captured during gameplay.

It's crucial to understand that these guidelines are supplementary to, rather than replacements for, the remainder of our Terms. We kindly request that you refrain from engaging in the following activities without our explicit permission:

* **Commercial Use:** Avoid engaging in any commercial activities related to our Names, Brands, or Assets.
* **Profit-Making:** Do not seek to generate profits or income using our Names, Brands, or Assets, unless authorized by us.

Please take note that certain assets found on our Service may be subject to copyright protection by other individuals or entities, and their usage may be subject to distinct brand asset and usage guidelines. For specific attributions, refer to our Credits and Attributions page.

## Service Suspension

As a user, you acknowledge and accept that we reserve the right to immediately suspend, terminate, discontinue, or restrict your access to any of our Services without prior written notice or consent. The grounds for such suspension, termination, discontinuation, or access limitation may include, but are not limited to:

1. Violation of our Terms, any other incorporated agreement, regulation, and/or guideline.
2. Compliance with requests from law enforcement or governmental agencies.
3. Alteration, discontinuation, or material modification to our Services or any of their components.
4. Unforeseen technical or security issues or challenges.
5. Involvement in fraudulent or unlawful activities.
6. Failure to make payments for any associated fees linked to your account Services.

Additionally, you hereby agree that all terminations, suspensions, discontinuations, or access limitations for any of the aforementioned reasons will be at our sole discretion. We shall not be held liable to you or any third party regarding the termination of your account or access to any of our Services. Account termination may encompass any or all of the following actions:

1. Revocation of access to all or part of the Services provided on our Site.
2. Deletion of your password and any associated information, files, or content linked to your account.
3. Prohibition of any future use of all or part of our Services.

For residents of the European Union, it's important to note that you have the right to request the removal of your personally identifiable information from our systems at any time and for any reason. We will take appropriate steps to attempt to erase all personally identifiable information from our systems, except for information intentionally posted to circumvent our filtration systems. Information related to billing or payments from transactions on our Site will not be deleted, as processing this data is within our legitimate interest ([GDPR Article 6, Section 1, Literary f](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/)). This is necessary to resolve billing disputes or inquiries that may arise from certain purchases.

## Payments, Virtual Currency, Billing and Refunds

On our platform, we offer a range of subscription services, virtual currency packages, and various other merchandise or services available for purchase. These items are collectively referred to as "Payable Services." It's important to note that when you make a payment for a Payable Service, you are making that payment directly to us. However, there are certain guidelines and restrictions in place when it comes to making purchases on our Service:

1. **Unauthorized Payment Methods:** You are strictly prohibited from using a payment method without the explicit permission of the authorized user. Under no circumstances should you use a payment method without proper authorization.
2. **Unauthorized Account Access:** Similarly, you must refrain from accessing another user's Account with the intention of making payments for a Payable Service. Unauthorized access to another user's Account for such purposes is strictly prohibited.

Accounts associated with unauthorized purchases will face termination and will lose access to the Service. Furthermore, we retain the right to permanently restrict access to the Service for individuals engaged in or conducting fraudulent purchases. By making a payment on the Service, you affirm that you are the authorized user of the payment method and that you possess the necessary funds to complete the purchase. Your agreement to this payment acknowledges your commitment to these conditions.

## Pricing and Payments

Our Site displays the current prices and accepted payment methods, but it's important to note that these details may undergo occasional changes at our discretion. We retain the right to refuse any form of payment and may choose to refund the payment to you without finalizing a transaction, particularly in cases where the item was inaccurately posted or priced due to an error. When making payments, you are required to use the currency specified on our Site, which is U.S. dollars. However, if necessary, your credit card company can facilitate the currency exchange process. Furthermore, your credit card company may conduct verification checks to ensure the authenticity of the purchase, thus enhancing security and protecting your interests as the rightful account holder.

## Virtual Currency

We offer a singular form of virtual currency within our Service. It's important to understand that, in accordance with applicable laws, this virtual currency holds an exchangeable value with real-world monetary value. This virtual currency, known as "Cubes," can be obtained through various means, including but not limited to:&#x20;

(i) direct purchase of Cubes from our platform;&#x20;

(ii) acquiring them through a membership subscription that grants a monthly allowance;&#x20;

(iii) participating in promotions, giveaways, or contests hosted on the Service;&#x20;

(iv) engaging in transactions, such as selling items or content to other users who possess Cubes; or (v) other methods as specified by us.

Cubes are exclusively intended for use within our online Services. It is strictly forbidden, for any reason, to engage in activities such as selling, trading, distributing, lending, exchanging, or conducting transactions involving Cubes outside the boundaries and features of our Service. We neither support nor condone any transactions involving Cubes outside of our Service, and any accounts associated with such activities will face termination. It's important to note that no refunds will be issued for Cubes involved in transactions of this nature.

You should be aware that we retain the right to determine the value of Cubes at any time, including potential changes to their supply. Additionally, we may take actions that can influence the perceived value or devalue Cubes as we see fit. At our discretion, we reserve the right to revoke your ability to use Cubes or access features associated with them. This may include the ability to purchase items, trade items, or initiate transactions involving your Cubes.

In summary, our management of Cubes is subject to our sole discretion, and your use of this virtual currency and its associated features is governed by these terms and conditions. We urge users to adhere to the designated boundaries for Cubes use within our Service to ensure a fair and secure environment for all.

## Billing

### Membership Subscription Renewal&#x20;

When you purchase a membership subscription, please be aware that your subscription will not automatically renew unless you opt to renew it.

### Refunds for Payable Services

We strive to ensure the satisfaction of our users and thus offer the option for refunds on specific purchases of our Payable Services. Without prejudice to any statutory rights you may have, we will issue refunds upon request for account membership subscriptions if the request is made within five-seven (5-7) days of the initial purchase, however their is a purchase legal clause:

Once a user submits an agreement to receive cubes as a result of a monetary purchase, a legal contract is entered into, wherein the user expressly agrees not to initiate chargebacks, legal actions, or any form of dispute for a refund. By digitally signing this agreement, the user voluntarily forfeits their right to pursue a jury trial or request a refund, thereby acknowledging the binding nature of this commitment and consenting to abide by the terms outlined therein. Refunds will not be provided in cases where such an agreement has been entered into, as the user's compliance with the agreed terms is considered legally binding.

The inclusion of this clause is necessitated by the fact that monetary purchases for cubes hold a tangible value within the Developer Exchange, and once a user expends this currency, it becomes irreversible. Refunds will only be considered under the following circumstances: if the user has not utilized any of the purchased cubes, or if they possess a quantity of cubes that corresponds to the equivalent value of the monetary purchase. In cases where these conditions are not met, we are unable to provide refunds, as the financial transactions are integral to the in-game economy and cannot be readily undone.

### Non-Refundable Payable Services and Additional Purchases

It's important to note that certain Payable Services or website purchases are non-refundable. According to applicable law, the following types of purchases will not be eligible for refunds:

* Purchases involving Cubes.
* Purchases of virtual items, games, or other user-generated content.

### Requesting Refunds

To request a refund, navigate to your account settings page and access the "Billing" tab. Please be aware that players can only request refunds for memberships less than seven (7) days old. All refund requests are subject to review, and we reserve the right to refuse refunds to any user for any reason. If your refund request is approved, your automatically renewing subscription will be canceled. Refunds will be processed within seven (7) business days by our team.

### Refund Types

Refunds will be issued in U.S. dollars, and, in most cases, will be processed back to the original payment method. However, in some circumstances, refunds cannot be returned to the original payment method. In such cases, your account will be credited with the dollar amount of the purchase, which can then be used to purchase additional Payable Services on our Site. Please note that account credit cannot be converted into cash and can only be used on our Site. If a refund is issued as account credit, it will be available immediately upon approval. However, if the refund is processed back to the original payment method, it may take some time. Credit card refunds, for instance, may take five (5) to ten (10) business days to reflect on your card. If you haven't received your refund after ten (10) days, please contact us.

### Refund Abuse

While we do allow users to request refunds to maintain a positive relationship, we must emphasize that abusing the refund system is not acceptable. If it appears that you are consistently exploiting the refund process, we reserve the right to cease offering refunds to you altogether. For instance, purchasing packages with the intent of requesting immediate refunds is considered an abuse of the refund process.

### Refund Exceptions

There are specific purchases that are ineligible for refunds, and these include:

* Accounts terminated for violations of our Terms or additional policies. Purchases for accounts that have been terminated due to violations of our Site policies, such as our terms of service, will not be eligible for refund requests. However, we may consider transferring the remaining membership subscription to a new account upon request (see "Membership Transfers" below).
* Purchases made on content that is removed from our Site. No refunds, credits, or compensation will be provided for funds spent on assets, images, clothing, games, or other content on our Service that has been removed due to violations of our Terms or for any other reason. We are not responsible for refunding losses incurred from the removal of such content.
