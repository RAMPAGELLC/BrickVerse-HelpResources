## User Advertising

**Independent Advertisement Publishing**

In lieu of using BrickVerse Immersive Ads, developers have the option to independently publish advertising content within their experiences. In such cases, the developer is responsible for directly uploading and controlling the delivery of the advertising content. It is vital to adhere to the following rules, in addition to all BrickVerse regulations, including the Terms of Use, Advertising Standards, and other Community Standards, as well as applicable laws and regulations. Failure to comply may result in action taken by us, such as content removal, experience suspension, or account suspension.

* Developers must maintain complete control over independent advertisement publishing. Experiences displaying independent ads must not make programmatic calls to third-party advertising services.
* Developers are prohibited from sharing personally identifiable user engagement information with advertisers and must comply with the Creator Analytics Terms of Use and BrickVerse Terms of Use in their handling of all user information.
* Developers must refrain from displaying advertising content to users under the age of 13. To accomplish this, developers should utilize BrickVerse tools, such as the AreAdsAllowed boolean in the PolicyService API, to replace, hide, or block access to advertising content for users not allowed to view ads.

_Note: Applying a 13+ Experience Guideline does not hide ad content from users under the age of 13. All ad content must be hidden using the PolicyService API._

* Developers must clearly and prominently disclose to users when content is an advertisement, using straightforward and understandable language. A reference to the advertiser's name alone is insufficient. Acceptable disclosure language includes terms like "ad," "paid," or "sponsored." This disclosure should be placed in or near the advertising content, ensuring it's noticeable and comprehensible to users.
* Developers are not allowed to mislead users into thinking that they are engaging with BrickVerse served Ads.
* Developers should not reuse or repurpose BrickVerse Immersive Ad content.
* Advertisements should not falsely represent the content being advertised to encourage user engagement (e.g., offering free Cubes).

For more detailed information on how to independently advertise, please consult our [Creator guidance](../../general/general/advertising-overview/complying-with-advertising-standards.md).

**Prohibited Advertising Practices and Content**

All advertisements on BrickVerse must adhere to BrickVerse's Advertising Standards. Creator guidance for complying with these standards can be found [here](../../general/general/advertising-overview/complying-with-advertising-standards.md).

**BrickVerse Economy**

BrickVerse maintains the Cube system for everyone’s benefit and enjoyment. To keep it fair for everyone, some activity in the BrickVerse Economy is prohibited, including:

* Using third-party services to buy, sell, trade, or give away Cubes (including BrickVerse gift cards).
* Engaging in off-platform, secondary market transactions for account access or virtual content from experiences or Marketplace (unless done by account holders as part of a verifiable agreement).
* Using the group payout system in a fraudulent or misleading manner, including offering payment in Cubes for modeling assets, joining groups, referring members, or role-playing in experiences.

**Promotional Offers**

Developers are permitted to use off-platform services or products to sell on-platform items (including exclusive features or in-experience enhancements) for money, directly or bundled.

Cubes are not permitted on off-platform services/products.

**Soliciting Donations:** Our community is not allowed to solicit donations for charitable causes on BrickVerse, including:

* In-experience prompts for users to donate Cubes toward crowdfunding campaigns.
* Claiming that a transaction is associated with a fundraiser.
* Stating that a portion of sales proceeds will be directed toward a cause.

_Note: Developers may implement in-experience Cubes transactions to allow users to express appreciation for the experience or generously reward a creator (e.g., a "tip jar" feature), provided it's clear that users receive nothing in return for their payment._

**Paid Random Items:** Paid random item generators include those purchased with Cubes directly or via in-experience currencies acquired with Cubes.

* Users are not permitted to trade or sell the resulting assets from paid random item generators for Cubes, real currency, or any other valuable item on BrickVerse.
* Creators must utilize the relevant PolicyService API to ensure paid random items are only accessible by eligible users.
* The odds of receiving each possible resulting item must be accurately disclosed to the eligible user before the moment of purchase.

## SMS Communication

## Brand and Asset Usage

Our games hold significant importance to both our team and our dedicated community of players. Many members of our community share a deep passion for utilizing our Brands and in-game elements to create fantastic experiences. Nevertheless, there are instances when individuals cross boundaries, leading to actions that mislead our community into believing that certain products or services are officially connected to, endorsed by, or produced by us. Such situations are far from ideal, particularly when users fall victim to intentional exploitation, purchasing goods under the false pretense that they are official. These incidents, in essence, compromise our ability to maintain the quality of products and services, thereby undermining the trust we've cultivated within our community.

We're committed to fostering creativity and innovation among our community by allowing you to work with the content we provide on our Site. To facilitate this, we have established a set of guidelines to clarify what constitutes fair and unfair use of our Name, Brand, and Assets. These guidelines serve the purpose of providing transparency, outlining actions that don't require prior approval from us, as well as actions that necessitate contacting us to ensure compliance.

These guidelines encompass the use of our Brand and Assets, specifically referring to:

1. **Name:** This pertains to the name of any game, its associated features, events, company identity, and any names closely resembling our games, features, events, or company identity.
2. **Brand:** This includes the brand name and related logo, as well as the distinctive characteristics of our game names and features.
3. **Assets:** Assets refer to the code, software, graphics, textures, images, models, sound, audio, or content originating from our games, as well as any videos or screenshots captured during gameplay.

It's crucial to understand that these guidelines are supplementary to, rather than replacements for, the remainder of our Terms. We kindly request that you refrain from engaging in the following activities without our explicit permission:

* **Commercial Use:** Avoid engaging in any commercial activities related to our Names, Brands, or Assets.
* **Profit-Making:** Do not seek to generate profits or income using our Names, Brands, or Assets, unless authorized by us.

Please take note that certain assets found on our Service may be subject to copyright protection by other individuals or entities, and their usage may be subject to distinct brand asset and usage guidelines. For specific attributions, refer to our Credits and Attributions page.

## Service Suspension

As a user, you acknowledge and accept that we reserve the right to immediately suspend, terminate, discontinue, or restrict your access to any of our Services without prior written notice or consent. The grounds for such suspension, termination, discontinuation, or access limitation may include, but are not limited to:

1. Violation of our Terms, any other incorporated agreement, regulation, and/or guideline.
2. Compliance with requests from law enforcement or governmental agencies.
3. Alteration, discontinuation, or material modification to our Services or any of their components.
4. Unforeseen technical or security issues or challenges.
5. Involvement in fraudulent or unlawful activities.
6. Failure to make payments for any associated fees linked to your account Services.

Additionally, you hereby agree that all terminations, suspensions, discontinuations, or access limitations for any of the aforementioned reasons will be at our sole discretion. We shall not be held liable to you or any third party regarding the termination of your account or access to any of our Services. Account termination may encompass any or all of the following actions:

1. Revocation of access to all or part of the Services provided on our Site.
2. Deletion of your password and any associated information, files, or content linked to your account.
3. Prohibition of any future use of all or part of our Services.

For residents of the European Union, it's important to note that you have the right to request the removal of your personally identifiable information from our systems at any time and for any reason. We will take appropriate steps to attempt to erase all personally identifiable information from our systems, except for information intentionally posted to circumvent our filtration systems. Information related to billing or payments from transactions on our Site will not be deleted, as processing this data is within our legitimate interest ([GDPR Article 6, Section 1, Literary f](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/)). This is necessary to resolve billing disputes or inquiries that may arise from certain purchases.

## Payments, Virtual Currency, Billing and Refunds

On our platform, we offer a range of subscription services, virtual currency packages, and various other merchandise or services available for purchase. These items are collectively referred to as "Payable Services." It's important to note that when you make a payment for a Payable Service, you are making that payment directly to us. However, there are certain guidelines and restrictions in place when it comes to making purchases on our Service:

1. **Unauthorized Payment Methods:** You are strictly prohibited from using a payment method without the explicit permission of the authorized user. Under no circumstances should you use a payment method without proper authorization.
2. **Unauthorized Account Access:** Similarly, you must refrain from accessing another user's Account with the intention of making payments for a Payable Service. Unauthorized access to another user's Account for such purposes is strictly prohibited.

Accounts associated with unauthorized purchases will face termination and will lose access to the Service. Furthermore, we retain the right to permanently restrict access to the Service for individuals engaged in or conducting fraudulent purchases. By making a payment on the Service, you affirm that you are the authorized user of the payment method and that you possess the necessary funds to complete the purchase. Your agreement to this payment acknowledges your commitment to these conditions.

## Pricing and Payments

Our Site displays the current prices and accepted payment methods, but it's important to note that these details may undergo occasional changes at our discretion. We retain the right to refuse any form of payment and may choose to refund the payment to you without finalizing a transaction, particularly in cases where the item was inaccurately posted or priced due to an error. When making payments, you are required to use the currency specified on our Site, which is U.S. dollars. However, if necessary, your credit card company can facilitate the currency exchange process. Furthermore, your credit card company may conduct verification checks to ensure the authenticity of the purchase, thus enhancing security and protecting your interests as the rightful account holder.

## Virtual Currency

We offer a singular form of virtual currency within our Service. It's important to understand that, in accordance with applicable laws, this virtual currency holds an exchangeable value with real-world monetary value. This virtual currency, known as "Cubes," can be obtained through various means, including but not limited to:&#x20;

(i) direct purchase of Cubes from our platform;&#x20;

(ii) acquiring them through a membership subscription that grants a monthly allowance;&#x20;

(iii) participating in promotions, giveaways, or contests hosted on the Service;&#x20;

(iv) engaging in transactions, such as selling items or content to other users who possess Cubes; or (v) other methods as specified by us.

Cubes are exclusively intended for use within our online Services. It is strictly forbidden, for any reason, to engage in activities such as selling, trading, distributing, lending, exchanging, or conducting transactions involving Cubes outside the boundaries and features of our Service. We neither support nor condone any transactions involving Cubes outside of our Service, and any accounts associated with such activities will face termination. It's important to note that no refunds will be issued for Cubes involved in transactions of this nature.

You should be aware that we retain the right to determine the value of Cubes at any time, including potential changes to their supply. Additionally, we may take actions that can influence the perceived value or devalue Cubes as we see fit. At our discretion, we reserve the right to revoke your ability to use Cubes or access features associated with them. This may include the ability to purchase items, trade items, or initiate transactions involving your Cubes.

In summary, our management of Cubes is subject to our sole discretion, and your use of this virtual currency and its associated features is governed by these terms and conditions. We urge users to adhere to the designated boundaries for Cubes use within our Service to ensure a fair and secure environment for all.

## Billing

### Membership Subscription Renewal&#x20;

When you purchase a membership subscription, please be aware that your subscription will not automatically renew unless you opt to renew it.

### Refunds for Payable Services

We strive to ensure the satisfaction of our users and thus offer the option for refunds on specific purchases of our Payable Services. Without prejudice to any statutory rights you may have, we will issue refunds upon request for account membership subscriptions if the request is made within five-seven (5-7) days of the initial purchase, however their is a purchase legal clause:

Once a user submits an agreement to receive cubes as a result of a monetary purchase, a legal contract is entered into, wherein the user expressly agrees not to initiate chargebacks, legal actions, or any form of dispute for a refund. By digitally signing this agreement, the user voluntarily forfeits their right to pursue a jury trial or request a refund, thereby acknowledging the binding nature of this commitment and consenting to abide by the terms outlined therein. Refunds will not be provided in cases where such an agreement has been entered into, as the user's compliance with the agreed terms is considered legally binding.

The inclusion of this clause is necessitated by the fact that monetary purchases for cubes hold a tangible value within the Developer Exchange, and once a user expends this currency, it becomes irreversible. Refunds will only be considered under the following circumstances: if the user has not utilized any of the purchased cubes, or if they possess a quantity of cubes that corresponds to the equivalent value of the monetary purchase. In cases where these conditions are not met, we are unable to provide refunds, as the financial transactions are integral to the in-game economy and cannot be readily undone.

### Non-Refundable Payable Services and Additional Purchases

It's important to note that certain Payable Services or website purchases are non-refundable. According to applicable law, the following types of purchases will not be eligible for refunds:

* Purchases involving Cubes.
* Purchases of virtual items, games, or other user-generated content.

### Requesting Refunds

To request a refund, navigate to your account settings page and access the "Billing" tab. Please be aware that players can only request refunds for memberships less than seven (7) days old. All refund requests are subject to review, and we reserve the right to refuse refunds to any user for any reason. If your refund request is approved, your automatically renewing subscription will be canceled. Refunds will be processed within seven (7) business days by our team.

### Refund Types

Refunds will be issued in U.S. dollars, and, in most cases, will be processed back to the original payment method. However, in some circumstances, refunds cannot be returned to the original payment method. In such cases, your account will be credited with the dollar amount of the purchase, which can then be used to purchase additional Payable Services on our Site. Please note that account credit cannot be converted into cash and can only be used on our Site. If a refund is issued as account credit, it will be available immediately upon approval. However, if the refund is processed back to the original payment method, it may take some time. Credit card refunds, for instance, may take five (5) to ten (10) business days to reflect on your card. If you haven't received your refund after ten (10) days, please contact us.

### Refund Abuse

While we do allow users to request refunds to maintain a positive relationship, we must emphasize that abusing the refund system is not acceptable. If it appears that you are consistently exploiting the refund process, we reserve the right to cease offering refunds to you altogether. For instance, purchasing packages with the intent of requesting immediate refunds is considered an abuse of the refund process.

### Refund Exceptions

There are specific purchases that are ineligible for refunds, and these include:

* Accounts terminated for violations of our Terms or additional policies. Purchases for accounts that have been terminated due to violations of our Site policies, such as our terms of service, will not be eligible for refund requests. However, we may consider transferring the remaining membership subscription to a new account upon request (see "Membership Transfers" below).
* Purchases made on content that is removed from our Site. No refunds, credits, or compensation will be provided for funds spent on assets, images, clothing, games, or other content on our Service that has been removed due to violations of our Terms or for any other reason. We are not responsible for refunding losses incurred from the removal of such content.

## Alternate Accounts

The use of alternate accounts by the same individual is strictly prohibited in our community. Unauthorized use of such accounts may result in the imposition of IP bans without prior permission from BrickVerse.

Our system is designed to automatically restrict accounts based on several factors, including the user's IP address, phone number, and email address. These measures are in place to ensure the integrity and security of our platform and to maintain a fair and transparent environment for all users.

This prohibition extends to our code, content, and data hosted on our Service. In summary, it is imperative that you refrain from making any alterations or attempts to mimic our Site or brand.
