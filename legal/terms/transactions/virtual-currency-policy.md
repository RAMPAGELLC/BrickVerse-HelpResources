Welcome to BrickVerse's Virtual Currency Policy! In this document, we outline the rules and regulations governing the virtual currency known as "Cubes" within the BrickVerse ecosystem. Please read this policy carefully, as it contains important information regarding the use, administration, and governance of Cubes.

**2. Ownership and Administration**

BrickVerse reserves all authorities, rights, and administrative control over Cubes, including but not limited to the creation, distribution, and management of this virtual currency. By participating in transactions involving Cubes, you agree to abide by the terms and conditions set forth in this policy.

**3. Transaction Fees**

For transactions involving Cubes, BrickVerse imposes a Developer Exchange Tax (DevEx Tax) as follows:

* BrickVerse will not charge any percentage of the transaction amount (0%) as a direct transaction fee of your Cubes.
*   However, BrickVerse will retain a minimum percentage of the Cubes' valuation converted to USD as follows:

    * **Tier 1 Membership Users:** 40%
    * **Tier 2 Membership Users:** 30%
    * **Tier 3 Membership Users:** 10%

    This is entirely automatic, the amount your have in your DevEx balance is amount already calculated you have avaliable to fully withdraw.

**4. Developer Exchange Tax (DevEx Tax)**

The Developer Exchange Tax (DevEx Tax) is designed to account for the conversion of Cubes into real-world currency (USD) and to support the BrickVerse ecosystem's sustainability. The respective percentages mentioned in section 3 will be withheld from the Cubes' valuation when exchanging them to USD. Please note that the DevEx Tax remains constant during the time of the transaction and does not fluctuate.

**5. BrickVerse's Rights**

BrickVerse retains the authority to grant, revoke, or regulate the distribution and withdrawal of Cubes. We also reserve the right to evaluate each user's eligibility for a DevEx withdrawal to USD. The criteria for determining a user's fitness for withdrawal to USD will be detailed in the DevEx Portal.

**6. Success of DevEx Withdrawals**

BrickVerse does not guarantee the success of a DevEx withdrawal. Success may depend on various factors, including the user's compliance with our terms and conditions, their history within the BrickVerse platform, and their adherence to the DevEx Portal's guidelines.

**7. DevEx Valuation Variations**

DevEx Valuation and associated taxes may vary based on market conditions, platform performance, and other variables. It is important to recognize that the valuation and taxes applied to Cubes at the time of a transaction may differ from one transaction to another.

**8. Currency Valuation and Market Dynamics**

Cubes' valuation within the BrickVerse ecosystem is subject to market dynamics and may fluctuate over time.

**11. Exchange Rates**

The current rates is 100 Cubes  = $1 USD.

In simple terms, when you receive Cubes in BrickVerse, you can use them right away for various transactions. However, if you wish to convert them into real-world currency (USD) through DevEx, you'll need to wait for one week after receiving them. It's important to note that whether you spend your Cubes during the eligibility period or not, the amount you spent will be deducted from your DevEx Balance or pending balance. When you sell items and receive Cubes for them, you'll get the full amount based on the item's sale. The only part you'll lose is a percentage of the Cubes' value due to DevEx taxes when you decide to cash them out into USD.

Currency purchased & earned from membership is not eligible for Developer Exchange, only currency you made from transactions.
