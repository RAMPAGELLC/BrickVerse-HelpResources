# Biometric Privacy Notice

This notice regarding biometric privacy is provided to inform you about how BrickVerse collects, uses, shares, retains, and disposes of your Biometric Data when you utilize our services. "Biometric Data" encompasses two components:&#x20;

(i) "Biometric Identifiers," which consist of data generated by measurements of your biological characteristics, such as retina or iris scans, fingerprints, voiceprints, or scans of your hand or facial features;&#x20;

and (ii) "Biometric Information," which includes data derived from a Biometric Identifier that can be utilized to identify you.

Please carefully review this notice. When you engage with the BrickVerse identity verification process, you are granting consent for the collection, use, sharing, and retention of your Biometric Data as outlined in this notice.

**What type of Biometric Data do we handle?**&#x20;

* Facial geometry.

**How do we process it?**&#x20;

To facilitate our identity and age verification process, we enlist the services of Veriff and Persona. Veriff or Persona captures a photo of your ID and a selfie to verify your identity. The face geometry extracted from your ID and selfie is then scrutinized, and the age of your face is analyzed to compare it with the date of birth on your ID. This process serves to securely verify your age and identity while also detecting potential fraud. A limited number of BrickVerse personnel may access the photos of your ID and selfie stored by Veriff or Persona for compliance purposes.

**How long do we retain your Biometric Data?**&#x20;

BrickVerse does not receive a copy of, nor have access to, your Biometric Data. Our service provider, Veriff or Persona, will respectively delete your Biometric Data within 90 days after collection, unless they are obligated by law, such as a warrant or subpoena, to retain your Biometric Data for a longer duration.

**What happens to your Biometric Data at the end of the retention period?**&#x20;

Both of our service providers, Veriff and Persona, permanently erase your Biometric Data at the conclusion of the retention period described above in a manner that ensures it cannot be recovered or reconstructed.

**Additional Privacy Disclosures and Your Rights** For further insights into how we manage your personal information, as well as your rights and choices concerning our data practices, please consult our Privacy Policy.&#x20;
