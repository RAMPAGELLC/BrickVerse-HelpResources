**Last Updated: February 20, 2026**

This SMS Messaging Privacy Policy describes how Meta Games LLC ("BrickVerse," "we," "our," or "us") collects, uses, and protects personal information when you opt in to receive SMS messages.

BrickVerse SMS messaging is strictly limited to:

* Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) verification codes
* Parental approval confirmations (e.g., replying “Y” to approve a child’s request)

We do **not** send marketing or promotional messages via SMS.

***

### 1. Service Provider & Compliance

BrickVerse uses **Microsoft Azure Communication Services (ACS)** to deliver SMS messages.

Our messaging practices comply with:

* Microsoft Azure Communication Services requirements
* U.S. Carrier A2P 10DLC messaging regulations
* The Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), where applicable

***

### 2. Information We Collect

When you provide your phone number for SMS purposes, we may collect:

* Phone number
* Associated BrickVerse account ID
* Message response content (e.g., “Y” for approval)
* Timestamps
* Message delivery status

We collect only the minimum information necessary to provide authentication and parental authorization functionality.

***

### 3. How We Use SMS Information

We use SMS information solely to:

* Deliver secure verification codes
* Confirm parental authorization
* Prevent unauthorized access
* Maintain account security

We do not sell, rent, or share SMS opt-in data for marketing purposes.

***

### 4. Data Retention

SMS-related data is retained only as long as necessary to:

* Fulfill security and compliance obligations
* Prevent fraud or abuse
* Maintain system integrity

After this period, data is securely deleted or anonymized.

***

### 5. Security

SMS communications are transmitted through Microsoft Azure’s secure infrastructure. While we use commercially reasonable safeguards, SMS is not guaranteed to be fully secure due to inherent carrier limitations.

***

### 6. Message Frequency

Messages are sent only when triggered by:

* A login attempt requiring 2FA
* A child account initiating a parental approval action (in example: requesting to Friend a user)

Message frequency varies based on account activity.

***

### 7. Message & Data Rates

Message and data rates may apply depending on your mobile carrier and plan. BrickVerse is not responsible for carrier charges.

***

### 8. Opt-Out & Help

You may opt out of SMS messages at any time by replying:

* **STOP** – to cancel SMS messages
* **HELP** – for assistance

{% hint style="warning" %}
Opting out will disable SMS-based 2FA and parental approvals unless another verification method is configured.
