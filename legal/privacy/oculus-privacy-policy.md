## Introduction&#x20;

At BrickVerse, safeguarding your privacy is paramount. We meticulously consider privacy implications with every addition to our platform to ensure your data remains secure.

Supplementary to our overarching Privacy Policy, the Oculus Privacy Policy specifically addresses concerns pertinent to Oculus users. You can access the complete Privacy Policy at [https://resources.brickverse.gg/legal/privacy/privacy-policy](https://resources.brickverse.gg/legal/privacy/privacy-policy).

## Oculus User Data&#x20;

When you engage with the Oculus Application, you will encounter a prompt to connect your Oculus Account with a BrickVerse.gg Account. This linkage persists until either your BrickVerse.gg account is deleted or you opt to unlink it at brickverse.gg/my/settings.

Within the BrickVerse.gg environment, certain Oculus account details, including your username and ID, are visible to Experience Developers, BrickVerse Staff, and fellow users. We ensure transparency regarding the visibility of this information.
