Any other capitalized term not defined in this Policy is defined and carries the meaning specified in the BrickVerse Dictionary. In the case of a substantial or apparent conflict between the English version of this Policy and translations into other languages, the English version shall take precedence.

## Are you under the age of 13 or are you responsible for someone who is?

If you're under 13 years old, we take privacy and safety seriously, and this section of our privacy policy is tailored to you.

**Obtaining Permission:**

If you're under the age of 13, please make sure to obtain permission from your parent or guardian before using BrickVerse. You should not use our services without their consent.

**Setting Boundaries:**

Regardless of your age, BrickVerse offers communication settings that enable you to control who can interact with you. For instance, you can choose to only allow interactions with friends or even disable all interactions altogether. Additionally, you have the option to restrict your account, which turns off chat and public commenting, limiting the account.

**Parental Supervision:**

Parents and guardians, we recommend that you supervise your child's activities while they are on BrickVerse. We provide tools to assist you in this regard, and you can learn more about BrickVerse's safety features here.

**Age-Appropriate Privacy Settings:**

If you are under 13 years old, your account will be automatically configured with strong privacy settings. While in this privacy mode, certain features like social media plug-ins, specific advertising, and alerts will be disabled. When you turn 13, you will have the option to enable additional features more suitable for users aged 13 and older.

**Information Collection for Users Under 13:**

For users under 13 years old who create an account, we will request some information, which is categorized as non-personal information under the **Children's Online Privacy Protection Act** (**COPPA**). This information includes:

* **Your Username (required):** This is necessary to create your account and operate the BrickVerse Service. Your username is not used to identify you outside of BrickVerse.
* **Your Password (required):** We need your password to log you into your account and manage the BrickVerse Service.
* **Your Birthday (required):** Your birthday is used to ensure that your account has the appropriate default settings for your age.
* **Your Gender (optional):** This information is used to customize your experience on BrickVerse.

For enhanced account security and parental controls, you have the option to provide a parent's or guardian's email address in your account settings or during logout. While we encourage children to provide a parent's email address, it's not mandatory to create an account.&#x20;

Parent email addresses, which are the only personal information as defined by COPPA that we collect from child accounts, are collected to ensure the security and integrity of your account and the BrickVerse platform. We may use your parent's email address to communicate with them about your account, such as requesting them to review and oversee your account.

**We Prioritize Your Privacy**

At BrickVerse, safeguarding your Personal Information is a top priority. If you're under 13 years old, we'll only ask for the necessary information to set up and protect your account. Should you choose to provide more Personal Information than required, we will take the following actions:

* Delete any additional Personal Information we've collected from you (unless the law mandates us to retain it).
* Cancel your account, or
* Activate age-appropriate protections on your account.

When users share content in public and comment areas, such as chat, forums, group walls, or personal posts, we implement filters to ensure your safety. These filters automatically remove:

* Personal Information like addresses, emails, and phone numbers.
* Attempts at phishing, which is when someone tries to trick you into sharing Personal Information.
* Offensive language, adult content, or suggestive content.

To provide this filtering, we utilize both human oversight and automated checks to the best of our ability based on available technology. However, like all filtering systems, they are not 100% foolproof.

**Request Privacy-Related Changes**

If you wish to make privacy-related changes, you can request that BrickVerse makes alterations to your child's account or allows you to review, delete, or prevent the further collection or use of Personal Information from you or your child. To initiate such a request, please complete our Customer Support Form.

We fully comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). To delve deeper into understanding COPPA, you can visit the official website of the US Federal Trade Commission dedicated to COPPA: [FTC COPPA Website](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/topics/protecting-consumer-privacy-security/kids-privacy-coppa).

This private key is stored in an encrypted form and if a breach occurs, your private key is not at risk.&#x20;

We encourage our users to never share their private key with anyone, because it can also be used to reset their passwords using the reset password with two step verification feature if their account does not disallow it.

## Statistics, scores, virtual currency and counts

To keep the platform fun and challenging to our users, we store statistics about our users. Below is outlined what kinds of statistics we store:

1. "Cubes" virtual currency - "Cubes" is our virtual currency used to and sell buy items for users' characters. This is increased over time (or when users sell items) and decreases when users buy virtual items. This value can only be seen by the user currently logged in and our administration team for moderation purposes.
