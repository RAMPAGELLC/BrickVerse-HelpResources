# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

We care a lot about your privacy. This is why we think with privacy in mind when adding any feature to our platform. In order to provide you our services, we need to store some basic information about your account.

## What kind of information is being stored?

We must store some information to provide you with our services. The amount of information depends on what you decide to post on our platform. All crucial information like your password are stored securely in such a way nobody including us can retrieve it.

### Your username, e-mail address, IP address and password

This platform stores your username(s), e-mail address(es) IP address and password(s) to store your account. Without this information, we can not provide you our services. Below is outlined exactly why this information is stored:

1. Usernames - Usernames are (often made up) aliases stored to identify one another on our platform. This information is required to login and find other users on both our website and game and is displayed on user profiles like this one
   1. Previous usernames are saved for records & reservations.
2. E-mail address - E-mail addresses are stored for both security reasons and your convenience. We request you to verify your e-mail address immediately after you create your account so we can verify you are a legitimate human being trying to use our website. Your e-mail address can also be used to retrieve your account when you forget your password using the reset password by e-mail address functionality that we provide.
   1. Previous e-mail addresses are saved for records & reservations.
3. IP addresses - IP addresses are stored for security and moderation purposes. Using your IP address, we are able to detect if you are really you using your own account and to find any violations of our terms of services within our platform. We reserve the right to block your IP address from our platform at any time for any reason.
   1. IP Addresses are logged when new IP Address is logged in, or new IP Address is detected while actively browsing.
      1. These logs help us prevent alternative accounts, as well provide additional account security for you. Our general administration staff cannot see IP Addresses, our Management Team can view such information upon request.
4. Passwords - Passwords are stored to secure our user accounts with a secret word and/or a combination of numbers. Your passwords are stored securely within our database server in such way that nobody including us, can retrieve your password. Without passwords, users can not access their account securely.
   1. No staff members have database access, strictly Chief Development Officer, and the Chief Executive Officer at RAMPAGE Interactive.

## Two Step Verification

If your account has Two Step Verification enabled, we store a random set of characters that represent your private key that is being used to generate a randomized 6 digit code every 30 seconds. This private key is stored in an encrypted form and if a breach occurs, your private key is not at risk. We encourage our users to never share their private key with anyone, because it can also be used to reset their passwords using the reset password with two step verification feature if their account does not disallow it.

## Content voluntarily posted by our users

We store user generated content posted voluntarily by our users to provide our users with user generated content. This content may include forum posts or user created items in our store. The amount of content that is stored in this category depends on the amount of content an user decides to share with our community. W

e highly encourage our users to never post any personal content. If you want your information removed because you (accidentally) posted such information, please contact our support team at [support@brickverse.co](mailto:support@BrickVerses.co) for assistance. Some content have ability to be deleted by yourself.

## Statistics, scores, virtual currency and counts

To keep the platform fun and challenging to our users, we store statistics about our users. Below is outlined what kinds of statistics we store:

1. "Cubes" virtual currency - "Cubes" is our virtual currency used to and sell buy items for users' characters. This is increased over time (or when users sell items) and decreases when users buy virtual items. This value can only be seen by the user currently logged in and our administration team for moderation purposes.
2. The amount of forum posts users have made - This is a number that indicates how many forum posts users have posted which increases when users post new messages on the forums and may decrease when moderators remove their messages whenever needed.
3. Join dates - When accounts are created, a timestamp is recorded immediately during the creation of these accounts. These dates indicate when someone has joined our website and can be seen by everyone on either forum messages or their profiles
4. Last seen dates - When users use our website, we record the timestamp of their last visit to measure if they are online or not. These dates indicate when someone has last visited our website and can be seen by everyone on their respective user profile
5. Security related timestamps - For the security of our users, we store timestamps of users for whenever they change their password, email address or other security related features. The amount of dates that relate to this is not a constant value and can change over time
6. User Generated Content timestamps "UGC" - To show relevant content to our users, we store timestamps of UGC when they are created. The amount of dates that relate to this is not a constant value and can change over time.
7. Account DOB Age. - Information is viewable by our support team. This information is also used automatically in backend for moderation and restrictions.
8. General account information - Our support team can see general account information such as Email, Email History, Username, Username History, Rank, Plan, Billing Information, Billing History, DOB, Gender, Phone Number, Phone History, Permissions/Ranking, Social Links, Bot account information, membership information, security related timestamps, timestamps, parental pin, parental control, parental overview, storage limits, account debt, moderation and more.

## Details relating to account sessions

For the convenience of our users, details are being stored when you login into any account. Owners of these accounts can see details of these sessions to make sure if their accounts are still safe. This information can not be seen by anyone other than the account owners. The information that we store in these cases are outlined below:

1. User agents - This is a string of characters that can tell websites like ours what browser someone is using, and what OS (Operation System) someone is using
2. Country codes - This is being stored so users can easily make sure if someone else is on their account or if they left a session running. More often than not, this makes the process of making sure nobody else is in their account(s) a lot easier
3. Last used timestamp - This contains the time when the session in question was used for the last time
4. IP Address
