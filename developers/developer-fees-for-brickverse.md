# Developer Fees for BrickVerse

Welcome to BrickVerse, the dynamic and innovative social platform dedicated to empowering teens and unleashing their creativity in the world of game development. In this guide, we'll provide you with essential information about developer fees on BrickVerse, how to make your game public or available for paid access, and the benefits of these fees.

### Game Creation and Initial Privacy Settings

At BrickVerse, we believe in fostering creativity and providing opportunities for game development without any upfront costs. When you create a game on our platform, the entire game creation process is entirely free. Upon creation, all games are automatically set to private mode, meaning only the game creator and their designated developers can access and play the game.

### Making Your Game Public or Available for Paid Access

If you wish to make your game accessible to all users on the BrickVerse platform or offer it for paid access, you'll need to go through a simple process and pay a one-time fee of $1,000 in Cubes (equivalent to approximately $10 USD in valuation). Cubes are our virtual currency, and they are used for various transactions on BrickVerse.

#### Benefits of Making Your Game Public:

* **Wider Audience:** By making your game public, you expose it to a larger user base, increasing its visibility and potential for success.
* **Monetization Opportunity:** If you choose to offer paid access, you can earn revenue from your game, helping you further invest in your development efforts.

#### Cube Fee Payment:

* The one-time $1,000 Cube Fee paid in Cubes, which can be purchased within the platform.

#### Updating Your Game:

Developers have the freedom to update their games at any time, whether they are published or not. This allows you to refine and enhance your game as you receive feedback and come up with new ideas.

#### Server Hosting Costs:

It's important to note that server hosting costs our company a substantial amount of money. To help offset these expenses, we've introduced the Cube Fee for making games public or available for paid access.

### Increasing Server Limits

By default, each game is limited to **one** server. If your game grows and you need additional server capacity, you can raise your server limit for a monthly fee of $500 Cubes (approximately $5 USD). This ensures that your game can handle more players and maintain a smooth gaming experience.

#### Cube Fee for Server Limit Increase:

* The $500 Cube Fee for increasing server limits is a monthly fee per extra server.

### Game Review and Moderation

When you publish your game on BrickVerse, it goes through a review process to ensure it meets our community standards. Your game will not be fully published until a BrickVerse.gg moderator has approved it. Please note that if your game is declined during the review process, you will **not** be refunded the Cube Fee.
