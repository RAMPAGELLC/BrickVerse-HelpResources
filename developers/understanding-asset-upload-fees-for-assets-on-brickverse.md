# Understanding Asset Upload Fees for Assets on BrickVerse

Welcome to BrickVerse, the dynamic and innovative social platform designed to empower teens and unleash their creativity in crafting captivating gaming experiences. As part of our commitment to providing a safe and enjoyable environment for our users, we have implemented upload fees for certain assets. This article aims to clarify the upload fees associated with audio and various assets to ensure a seamless experience for all users.

1. **Under 2 minutes:** 50 Cubes
2. **2 minutes:** 200 Cubes
3. **5 minutes:** 400 Cubes
4. **10 minutes:** 800 Cubes

The reason for these fees is to support our human moderators and leverage automated artificial intelligence systems to review and moderate audio content before it becomes available on the platform.

These fees apply to the upload of various assets like faces, textures, clothing items, and accessories. The charges contribute to the moderation process and the overall maintenance of a vibrant and secure community.

1. **Moderation:** The fees support the efforts of our moderation team and artificial intelligence systems in reviewing and ensuring the appropriateness of content.
2. **Resource Allocation:** By implementing upload fees, we can allocate resources more efficiently to handle the moderation of a high volume of uploads, ensuring a quicker and safer experience for everyone.
3. **Encouraging Responsible Use:** The fees also serve as a measure to encourage responsible use of the platform, discouraging users from uploading excessive or inappropriate content.

## No Refunds Policy

At BrickVerse, we understand the importance of a transparent and fair policy regarding upload fees. It's crucial to note that all upload fees, whether for audio or various assets, are non-refundable. This policy is in place to ensure a consistent and efficient moderation process, and it applies regardless of whether the uploaded content is accepted or denied.

**Refund Exceptions:**

The only exception to this policy is in the case of a system error, which is solely at the discretion of our dedicated staff. If a user encounters a technical issue or error during the upload process that results in an unintended charge, we encourage them to reach out to our support team promptly. Our staff will carefully review and assess each case on an individual basis to determine if a refund is warranted due to a system error.

**Reasons for the No Refunds Policy:**

1. **Moderation Resources:** The upload fees contribute to the allocation of resources for the moderation process. Even if content is denied, the resources and efforts expended in the moderation review have already been utilized.
2. **Platform Sustainability:** The no refunds policy ensures the sustainability of the platform by helping cover operational costs, including moderation, server maintenance, and ongoing improvements.
3. **Discouraging Abuse:** Implementing a strict no refunds policy discourages potential abuse of the system, promoting responsible use of the BrickVerse platform.

While we strive to provide a seamless and enjoyable experience for our users, we appreciate your understanding of our refund policy.

## Automated Moderation Systems at BrickVerse

At BrickVerse, we are committed to providing a safe and enjoyable environment for our community. To uphold these standards, we employ advanced automated moderation systems that rigorously analyze uploaded content. When you upload an audio file or assets utilizing textures, these automated systems kick into action to ensure compliance with our community guidelines. Here's how the moderation process works:

**Audio Uploads:**

Upon uploading an audio file, it undergoes automated moderation using ACRCloud for Copyright detection and Nebula Laboratories for Speech Detection. These systems help us identify and handle potential copyright violations and speech content that may violate our guidelines.

**Texture-Utilizing Assets:**

For assets utilizing textures, our automated moderation is powered by Microsoft Azure Content Moderator. This robust system scans for a variety of content including nudity, sexual content, child sexual abuse material (CSAM), alcohol, tobacco, drugs, violence, weapons, gore, profanity, and vulgarity.

**Automated Moderation Actions:**

If any of our automated systems detect a violation, they will automatically issue moderation actions. These actions vary depending on the severity and nature of the violation and can include:

1. **Warnings:** Users may receive a warning for minor violations, providing an opportunity to rectify the issue without severe consequences.
2. **Bans:** For more serious or repeated violations, users may face temporary bans, restricting their access to certain features or the platform as a whole.
3. **Account Terminations:** In cases of severe or repeated violations, the account may be terminated, resulting in a permanent removal from BrickVerse.

**Reasons for Automated Moderation:**

1. **Protecting Community Standards:** Automated moderation helps maintain a high standard of content on BrickVerse, ensuring a positive and safe experience for all users.
2. **Efficiency:** With a high volume of uploads, automated systems enable us to efficiently and promptly address potential issues without overwhelming our human moderation team.
3. **Consistency:** Automated systems provide a consistent approach to content moderation, treating all users fairly and impartially.

**Appeals and Customer Support:**

We understand that automated systems are not infallible. If you believe your content was flagged erroneously, or if you have questions about moderation actions taken against your account, please reach out to our customer support. We are here to assist you and ensure a fair resolution to any concerns you may have.

Thank you for your cooperation in creating a vibrant and safe community on BrickVerse. Together, we can foster a creative and positive environment for all users.
