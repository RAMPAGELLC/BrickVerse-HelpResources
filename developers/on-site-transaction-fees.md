# On-Site Transaction Fees

When you earn currency on BrickVerse through sales or purchases made inside experiences, the full amount does not go to a single party. Like most creator platforms, BrickVerse applies a platform fee that helps support hosting, security, moderation, payment processing, and continued platform development.

Below is a breakdown of how revenue is shared across different types of transactions.

***

### 💳 Entitlements

**Examples:** Game Passes, Subscriptions, Consumables, etc.

* **70% → Developer**
* **30% → BrickVerse**

These purchases directly support the developer who created the experience or item.

***

### 🛍 Marketplace Sales (UGC Items)

**Examples:** Clothing, Hats, Hair, Accessories

* **50% → UGC Creator**
* **50% → BrickVerse**

{% hint style="success" %}
Marketplace items rely on platform discovery, storage, moderation, and delivery systems, which is why the platform share is higher for these sales.
{% endhint %}

### 🔁 Marketplace Listing Sales (Reselling a Tradable Item)

When a user resells a tradable item originally created by a UGC creator:

* **60% → Seller (the user who listed the item)**
* **30% → Original UGC Creator**
* **10% → BrickVerse**

This system rewards both the original creator and the user participating in the secondary marketplace.
