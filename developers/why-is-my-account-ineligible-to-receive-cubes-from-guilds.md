# Why is my account ineligible to receive cubes from Guilds?

If you’re unable to receive Cubes from a Guild, don’t worry — this is usually temporary and related to account safety protections.

#### 🚫 Common Reasons

Your account may be temporarily restricted from receiving Guild payouts for one or more of the following reasons:

* **Your account is too new**\
  Brand new accounts have limited trading and payout abilities while trust is established.
* **You recently joined the Guild**\
  Guild membership must be active for a short period before Cube transfers are allowed.
* **Security or trust concerns**\
  Our systems may detect unusual or suspicious activity patterns. This can include rapid account changes, unusual login behavior, or activity that resembles Cube abuse or laundering.
* **Previous rule violations**\
  Accounts with a history of moderation action may have additional restrictions.

#### ✅ When will I become eligible?

Most accounts automatically become eligible once the following conditions are met:

* You have been in the **Guild for at least 7 days**
* Your **Brickverse account is at least 14 days old**

As long as there are no additional security concerns, access is restored automatically.

#### 🔒 Why do these limits exist?

These protections help keep the Brickverse economy fair and safe. Without them, bad actors could:

* Create throwaway accounts to move Cubes between users
* Exploit Guild systems for fraudulent payouts
* Launder stolen or illicitly obtained Cubes
* Abuse promotional or reward systems

By adding short waiting periods, we make it much harder for scammers and bots to operate, while keeping things smooth for legitimate players.

#### ❓ What should I do now?

If you’re currently ineligible:

1. Make sure your account meets the **age** and **Guild membership** requirements
2. Avoid suspicious behavior (VPN hopping, account sharing, automation, etc.)
3. Simply wait — most restrictions lift automatically

If you believe your account was restricted in error **and you meet the requirements**, you can contact support through the Help Center.
