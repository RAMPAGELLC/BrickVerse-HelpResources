## About it

All logos/photos/images/textures in-game/on-site such as a Guild Logo/Banner, Clothing, or a in-game texture requrie uploading on-site (or in studio).

## Why do we need to upload as a texture asset?

Everything internally is treated as Developer Asset texture, this allows us to use the same moderation tooling on game developer assets to be re-used on site things like Guild logos

## Where do I upload?

You can upload a texture at [https://brickverse.gg/create/assets](https://brickverse.gg/create/assets) and selecting "**Texture**"
