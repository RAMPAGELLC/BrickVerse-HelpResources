# Vault Storage Introduction

Welcome to BrickVerse.gg, your gateway to a world of endless adventures and creativity. In this guide, we'll explore Vault Storage and how it works, including the default limit of **300MB**, as well as how you can extend your storage through Astro membership plans. Please note that exceeding your storage limit can lead to **temporary-to-permanent account locking**, so it's essential to manage your storage wisely.

### Vault Storage Purpose

The purpose of Vault Storage on BrickVerse is to provide developers with a seamless and organized way to manage their assets while allowing them to keep track of their storage usage efficiently. As a young company, BrickVerse acknowledges the need for additional resources to host the diverse and creative content of our users. This, however, necessitates certain limitations to ensure sustainable growth and performance. While we may not have the same level of freedom as some more established companies, our commitment to offering an immersive and creative platform remains steadfast, and we continuously work to strike a balance between resource management and user experience to provide you with the best possible environment for your creative endeavors.

### Vault Storage Overview

Vault Storage is a crucial component of your BrickVerse.gg experience. It serves as a secure space where you can store various assets, such as clothing, audio, games, and more. This storage is essential for unleashing your creative potential within the BrickVerse community.

### Default Storage Limit

By default, each BrickVerse.gg account comes with a **300MB** storage limit. While this is a reasonable starting point, it might not be sufficient if you plan to create, share, and enjoy a wide range of assets on the platform.

### Extending Your Storage

To ensure you have enough space for all your creative endeavors, BrickVerse.gg offers three tiers of Astro membership plans:

1. **Astro Basic**: This plan offers an additional **600MB** of storage, increasing your total storage capacity to **900MB**.
2. **Astro Standard (also called Astro)**: Astro Standard doubles your storage to **2GB** (**2,000MB** + **300MB** with your default storage.), providing even more room for your creations.
3. **Astro Premium**: For those with the most ambitious projects, Astro Premium extends your storage capacity to a generous **8GB** (**8,000MB**  + **300MB** with your default storage.).

#### How to Upgrade Your Storage with Astro

1. Log in to your BrickVerse.gg account.
2. Navigate to your account settings.
3. Select the **"Upgrade Stars"** option on the bottom left side-bar.
4. Choose the Astro plan that best suits your needs.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the upgrade process.

Once you've upgraded your membership plan, your additional storage capacity will be immediately available, allowing you to continue building and sharing your creations without worrying about storage constraints.

### Account Locking

It's essential to be aware that if your account's storage usage exceeds its limit, your account will be **temporarily locked** until you upgrade to the required storage amount. This means you won't be able to access your assets or interact with the BrickVerse community until you've resolved the issue.

To prevent account locking and maintain uninterrupted access to BrickVerse.gg, make sure to monitor your storage usage and consider upgrading your membership plan if you approach the limit.

Account's locked are marked as Account Closed (aka Terminated) and will be put in the termination queue. You have ninety (90) days upon closure to either;

* Contact BrickVerse.gg Support and request account vault wipe. Your new storage limit will be put to 0MB, preventing any uploads.
* Upgrade your account storage limit, or delete certain assets.

If you fail todo any of this within 90 days, your account data (vault storage such as assets, username, history, EVERYTHING!) will be deleted, and will be permanently unabled to be recovered.

### Managing Vault Storage Usage

To efficiently manage your Vault Storage, follow these best practices:

1. Regularly review and clean up unused assets to free up storage space.
2. Use storage efficiently by optimizing and compressing your assets when possible.
3. Consider upgrading your Astro membership plan if you consistently approach the storage limit, or purchasing additional storage within account settings. Please note account storage upgraded in settings is removed monthly until you re-activate it by purchasing it again. Storage from membership will be removed upon membership ending.

By following these tips, you can ensure a seamless and creative experience on BrickVerse.gg without encountering storage-related interruptions.

BrickVerse.gg is all about fostering your creativity, and Vault Storage plays a crucial role in that journey. By understanding the default limits, the Astro membership plans, and the consequences of exceeding your storage, you can make the most of your time in this exciting online world.
