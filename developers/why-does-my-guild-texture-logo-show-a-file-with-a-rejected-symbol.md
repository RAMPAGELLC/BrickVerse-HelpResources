# Why does my Guild texture/logo show a file with a 🚫 (rejected) symbol?

If you uploaded a texture, logo, or image for your Guild and it’s showing a **file icon with a deny/restricted symbol**, it means the asset has not been approved for use on Brickverse.

This can happen for one of two reasons:

***

## 🔍 1. Your texture is still under review

All uploaded images go through **automatic AI moderation** to make sure they follow Brickverse rules.

### 🕒 **Review time**

Most assets are reviewed within **1–5 minutes**, though it can occasionally take a bit longer during busy periods.&#x20;

While the system is reviewing your upload, it may temporarily appear as **unavailable or rejected**. If it passes review, it will automatically become visible on your Guild/in-game.

***

## 🚫 2. Your texture was rejected by moderation

If the AI system determines that your upload violates Brickverse guidelines, the texture will be permanently rejected.

Common reasons include:

* Inappropriate or explicit imagery
* Hate symbols or extremist content
* Harassment or targeted abuse
* Copyrighted material you don’t have rights to use
* Attempts to bypass moderation (filters, hidden text, etc.)

When an upload is rejected **for rule violations**, moderation action may also be taken on your account. Depending on severity, this can include:

* A **warning**
* A **temporary suspension**
* **Permanent account termination** (for serious or repeated violations)

If action is taken, you will receive a notification explaining what happened.

## 🤖 How Brickverse image moderation works

All textures and logos are scanned by **automated AI moderation systems**. These systems determine whether an asset is safe and allowed on the platform.

Moderation decisions are made automatically and applied immediately to keep the community safe.

***

## ❓ What should I do?

* If your upload is new → **wait a few minutes** and refresh.
* If it remains rejected → upload a **different image** that follows the rules.
* If you received a moderation notice and believe it was a mistake → follow the appeal instructions included in that notice.

## 👩‍💼 Human Review of AI Moderation

While all texture and logo uploads are initially handled by our **AI moderation system**, Brickverse also has a team of **human moderators** who **daily review the actions taken by the AI**.

This means:

* **Approvals and denials are double-checked** to ensure fairness and accuracy.
* If the AI made a mistake, moderators can **override the decision** and restore your texture or logo.
* Moderators ensure that the system is **consistent with community guidelines** and evolving standards.

Even though the AI works quickly, human oversight helps catch errors and maintain a fair experience for all users.
