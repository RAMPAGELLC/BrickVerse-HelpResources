# Why Is My Transaction Pending? Where Is My Money?

When you buy an item in Brickverse — like a hat or a game pass in a world — the payment process happens in **two stages**. Seeing a **“Pending”** status is normal, and your Cubes are not lost.

Let’s break it down 👇

***

### 🧾 What Happens When You Make a Purchase

Every time you purchase something, Brickverse creates a **transaction between you (the buyer) and the seller (the creator)**.

#### For Buyers

* Your **Cubes are removed instantly** from your account at the time of purchase.
* This confirms the transaction was successfully started.
* You should receive the item (hat, pass, etc.) right away.

So if your balance went down — the payment went through on your end ✅

***

### 💰 Why Sellers See “Pending”

On the seller’s side, the Cubes from that purchase will show as **“Pending”** in their transaction portal.

This means:

* The transaction is recorded
* The Cubes are being held temporarily
* The seller has **not** received the funds yet

This delay is **intentional and for safety**.

***

### 🛡️ Why Do We Delay Payments?

Brickverse holds seller earnings for a period of time (sometimes **a few days, sometimes a few weeks**) to help protect the community from:

* Fraudulent purchases
* Scams
* Payment disputes or chargebacks
* Abuse of the system
* Money laundering or other suspicious activity

This review period helps make sure transactions are legitimate before Cubes are fully delivered to the seller.

### ⏳ How Long Does “Pending” Last?

There’s no single exact timeframe. It depends on things like:

* Account history
* Transaction patterns
* Risk checks
* System reviews

Some payments clear quickly. Others may take longer if additional checks are needed.

***

### ❓ Is My Money Gone?

**No.**

* Buyers: Your purchase is complete, and your item should already be available to use.
* Sellers: Your Cubes are safely recorded and will move from **Pending → Available** once the holding period ends.

If a transaction is removed or reversed, it means it was flagged and stopped by our safety systems.

### 📩 Still Concerned?

If:

* You didn’t receive the item you paid for, or
* A transaction has been pending for an unusually long time

Please contact Brickverse Support with:

* Your username
* The transaction id

We’ll be happy to look into it.
