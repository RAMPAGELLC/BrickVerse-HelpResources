# World Creation & Developer Fees

All BrickVerse games run on **shared servers by default**. These servers are completely **free to use** and are automatically used when a player joins your game — no setup required.

This system works similarly to other large game platforms: when someone presses **Play**, BrickVerse finds an available shared server and starts your game session there.

#### **Key Things to Know**

* Shared servers are **always free**
* Any developer’s game can run on them
* Servers are automatically assigned when players join
* Availability may be limited during peak usage
* Performance may vary compared to dedicated servers

Because these servers are shared across the entire platform, you might occasionally experience:

* Slower startup times
* Slightly lower performance during high demand

But for most games — especially during development or with smaller player counts — shared servers work great.

### **Dedicated BrickCloud Servers (Optional Upgrade)**

Dedicated servers are **not required** to run your game. Instead, they are an **optional upgrade** for developers who want guaranteed resources and higher performance.

When you purchase BrickCloud servers:

* Those servers are **reserved only for your universe**
* Your game sessions will **prioritize your dedicated servers first**
* You get **more consistent performance and availability**

This is ideal for:

* High player counts
* Competitive or fast-paced games
* Games with heavy scripts or complex systems
* Developers who want maximum reliability

If no dedicated servers are available, your game can still fall back to shared servers (if enabled).

#### **Simple Comparison**

| Feature                | Shared Servers | Dedicated BrickCloud Servers |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Cost                   | Free           | Paid                         |
| Reserved for your game | ❌ No           | ✅ Yes                        |
| Availability           | Limited pool   | Guaranteed for your universe |
| Performance            | Variable       | More consistent              |
| Setup required         | None           | Deployment required          |

**In short:**\
Shared servers power the entire platform and are free for everyone. Dedicated BrickCloud servers are just there if you want your own guaranteed slice of infrastructure.
