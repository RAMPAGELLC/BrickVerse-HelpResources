# World Creation & Developer Fees

Welcome to BrickVerse, the dynamic and innovative social platform dedicated to empowering teens and unleashing their creativity in the world of game development. In this guide, we'll provide you with essential information about developer fees on BrickVerse, how to make your game public or available for paid access, and the purpose of these fees.

## Definitions

Before we dive deep in this guide is to go over definitions of BrickVerse Dev slang.

* Universe
  * A game root place. All worlds belong to a universe.
* World / Planet
  * A sub-place of a universe. Think of it as another scene such as a Main Menu, A Battle Royal Map, etc.
* BrickCloud Server / Dedicated server
  * A server instance reserved specific for a game universe.
* Shared Server
  * A server instance shared across the entire platform, not reserved for any universe.

### Game Creation and Initial Privacy Settings

At BrickVerse, we believe in fostering creativity and providing opportunities for game development without any upfront costs. When you create a game on our platform, the entire game creation process is entirely free. Upon creation, all games are automatically set to private mode, meaning only the game creator and their designated developers can access and play the game.

**However in-order to play your game regardless if its public, paid access, private, or archived you must have** at least **one BrickCloud Server or a shared server must be available.** Server hosting is a **expensive** operation within the platform and we try to provide it as cheap as we can.

**NEW FREE SHARED SERVERS FOR EVERYONE**

BrickVerse is now providing **limited free servers** for **all** developers to use. Please note their is some limitations:\
\* Servers may be unavailable due to them all currently being utilized by developer(s).\
\* Servers are **not** reserved for any developer, they are provided for free for all developers.\
\* Servers may run poorer than a dedicated BrickCloud server.



Developers are unable to reserve free servers as they are dedicated for everyone. Servers are spined up upon a player pressing play, If your game has a dedicated server it will be prioritized instead of this shared server.



Developers are still able to purchase dedicated BrickCloud servers which are specifically reserved for their Universe only.



These free shared servers are paid entirely by BrickVerse Corporation. Purchasing membership, and donations help us with providing this service.

Active shared server(s) in-use by your universe are temporarily registered within the servers.brickverse.gg portal. E-mail notifications for the server(s) being added are disabled.
