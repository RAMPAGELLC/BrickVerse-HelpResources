# Brickverse Developer Exchange Program (DevEx)

The **Brickverse Developer Exchange Program (DevEx)** lets creators earn real money for building awesome experiences, items, and content on Brickverse.

This article explains how DevEx works, what your earnings mean, and what to expect when you’re ready to cash out.

***

### What is DevEx?

DevEx is a **creator payout program**, not a bank withdrawal system.

You earn **Brickverse Cubes** by:

* Selling items or game passes
* Participating in approved monetization programs

When you meet the requirements, eligible earnings can be exchanged for a **cash payout** through DevEx.

### About Brickverse Credits (Important!)

Brickverse cubes are a **virtual platform currency**:

* They are **not real money**
* They have **no guaranteed cash value**
* They can only be used inside Brickverse
* They cannot be redeemed on demand

When players buy cubes, Brickverse treats that purchase as **deferred revenue**. Revenue is only recognized when cubes are spent on platform content and features.

This model helps keep Brickverse:

* Stable
* Sustainable
* Fair to creators long-term

### How DevEx Payouts Work

DevEx payouts are **royalty payments** paid by Brickverse to creators.

That means:

* You’re being paid for the value your content brings to the platform
* Payouts come from Brickverse’s revenue, not from player balances
* Credits are **not converted 1:1 into cash**

#### Exchange Rates

* DevEx exchange rates are **set by Brickverse**
* Rates may change over time based on platform health, fees, taxes, and economics
* Brickverse does **not guarantee** a fixed rate

***

### Minimum Payout Requirement

To request a DevEx payout:

* Your eligible DevEx balance must equal **at least $100 USD**
* The value is calculated using the **current DevEx rate**
* Partial or smaller payouts are not supported

This minimum helps reduce fees, fraud, and processing delays—so payouts stay fast and reliable.

***

### Eligibility Requirements

To participate in DevEx, you must:

* Meet minimum age requirements
* Complete identity verification (KYC)
* Submit required tax forms
* Follow Brickverse Terms of Service and Community Rules
* Avoid fraud, abuse, or policy violations

Brickverse may suspend or revoke DevEx access if these rules aren’t followed.

***

### Taxes & Reporting

DevEx payouts are **taxable income**.

Depending on your location, Brickverse may:

* Issue tax forms (such as a 1099 or W-8BEN)
* Withhold taxes where required by law

You’re responsible for reporting your earnings to your local tax authority.

### A Few Things to Keep in Mind

* Brickverse cubes ≠ cash
* DevEx is optional and discretionary
* Payout rates can change
* Brickverse may pause, update, or end DevEx if needed
* Abuse of the system can result in loss of DevEx access
