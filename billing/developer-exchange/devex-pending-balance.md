# DevEx: Pending Balance

## Introduction

In the virtual realm of BrickVerse, a fascinating world brimming with creativity and limitless possibilities, players engage in various activities to earn a unique virtual currency known as Cubes.&#x20;

However, to maintain the integrity and fairness of this dynamic economy, BrickVerse employs a vigilant system called Pending Balance. This USD equivalent of Cubes represents the virtual currency that is currently under review by the system to prevent the devexing of unethically obtained Cubes.&#x20;

Just like the real-world financial systems, Pending Balance acts as a safeguard, ensuring that any Cubes earned through legitimate and honorable means can be rightfully exchanged while deterring those who may attempt to exploit or manipulate the system for personal gain. By doing so, BrickVerse fosters a supportive and equitable environment, where creativity and effort are rewarded, and the integrity of the virtual economy remains preserved.
