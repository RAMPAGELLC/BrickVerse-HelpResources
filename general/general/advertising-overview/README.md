# Advertising Overview

Advertising on BrickVerse presents an opportunity to engage with a audience and drive traffic to your content. We offer various official advertising products, and you also have the option to independently advertise within your experiences.

Regardless of the method you choose, all advertisements on our platform must strictly adhere to BrickVerse's Advertising Standards, Community Standards, and Terms of Use.

## BrickVerse-Served Ads

BrickVerse-served ads are advertisements that you can purchase and deliver through our official advertising products. Most of our advertising products enable you to select your target audience, set the duration of your ad campaign, and specify your daily budget.

The choice of advertising product depends on the nature of the content you wish to promote and your target audience. The table below outlines the type(s) of content suitable for each advertising product and the locations where the ads appear on BrickVerse:

* **Immersive Ads**: Suitable for promoting Experiences and Images. These ads appear within the Immersive Ad Units integrated into publisher experiences.
* **Sponsored Experiences**: Designed for promoting Experiences. They feature within the Sponsored category on the Home and Discover pages, and as Sponsored tiles within search results.
* **Sponsored Items**: Ideal for 3D user-generated content promotion. These ads appear within the Sponsored category on the main details page of any item on the BrickVerse website, as well as the Recommended Items for You section in the BrickVerse app Marketplace.
* **User Advertisements**: Perfect for promoting Experiences, 3D user-generated content for avatars, and groups. These ads are displayed on the top, bottom, left, or right side of the BrickVerse website.

## Independent Advertising

Independent advertisements typically fall outside of BrickVerse's official advertising products and are used to promote products or services that are external to the platform or not part of the BrickVerse experience. Such advertisements can take various forms. If you are a brand or developer collaborating with external advertisers and are uncertain whether your content qualifies as advertising, it is advisable to consult relevant regulatory guidance and seek legal counsel if necessary. Although not exhaustive, you might consider the following questions as a starting point to determine if your content constitutes advertising:

* Do you intend for the content to serve as advertising?
* Were you compensated to publish the content with the purpose of promoting a third-party product or service?
* Does the content create demand for a product or service available outside the experience where it is placed?
* Does the content explicitly or implicitly promote features of a product or service, such as quality, price, features, performance, attributes, or benefits?
* Does the content guide users on where or how to purchase something external to the experience?
* Does the content contain a call to action encouraging the purchase of something external to the experience?

If your content qualifies as advertising, it is your responsibility to ensure that it complies with all BrickVerse policies and any relevant local laws or regulations.&#x20;

For instance, independent advertisements must conform to BrickVerse's Independent Advertising Policy, Community Standards, and Terms of Use.&#x20;

This entails hiding advertisements from users ineligible to view ads and transparently disclosing that the content is indeed advertising in a manner understandable to BrickVerse users who encounter it. For further details, please refer to our Complying with Advertising Standards.
