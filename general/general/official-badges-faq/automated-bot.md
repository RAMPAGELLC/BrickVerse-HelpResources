## Introduction

BrickVerse's Bot Badge identities accounts which are automated & controled by a BrickVerse player.

This badge does not mean they are staff, or a authentic account. Authentic accounts/verified bots will have the verified badge along side it.

## How can I get it?

Unfortunately, this badge cannot be obtained. This badge is automatically issued to bot accounts.
