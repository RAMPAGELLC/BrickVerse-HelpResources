# Sponsored Content on Brickverse

**Sponsored Content** allows creators, brands, or organizations to **pay for promotional placement** within Brickverse. This ensures that your content reaches a wider audience, but it is **different from Featured Content**, which is curated by staff.

***

### 💵 How Sponsored Content Works

* **Paid promotion:** Anyone can pay to have their guild, market item, or game highlighted in prominent areas.
* **Placement:** Sponsored content may appear on the homepage, in discovery sections, or alongside other content.
* **Visibility:** Paid placement does **not guarantee curation or quality approval** beyond basic safety checks.
