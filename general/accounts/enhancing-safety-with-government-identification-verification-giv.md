# Enhancing Safety with Government Identification Verification (GIV)

At BrickVerse.co, we take the safety and security of our community seriously. To ensure that children, teens, and young adults have a safe and enjoyable multiplayer online platform for creating and playing games, we have implemented a Government Identification Verification (GIV) system. This system is powered by our trusted 3rd Party provider, Persona, which offers Age Verification AI & Fraud Protection AI. In this article, we'll explain how GIV works and the role of BrickVerse Safety Administration (BSA) in managing this process.

### Government Identification Verification (GIV) Overview

GIV is a robust verification system designed to confirm the age and identity of users on our platform. It helps us maintain a secure environment by ensuring that users meet the required age restrictions for our platform.

#### **How GIV Works:**

1. **Age Verification AI:** When a user registers an account on BrickVerse.co, they provide their date of birth. RAMPAGE Interactive's Age Verification AI analyzes this information to determine if the user is 21 years of age or older. If they are, they will be required to complete the GIV process powered by Persona. User's under 21 are not required to verify, however they still can submit a manual request for verification within settings. Some programs such as Developer Exchange require ID Verification.
2. **Fraud Protection AI:** Persona's Fraud Protection AI assists in detecting and preventing fraudulent attempts at age verification, helping to keep the platform safe from malicious users.
3. **Secure Document Upload:** Users who need to complete GIV will be prompted to upload a government-issued identification document, such as a driver's license or passport. This document is securely processed by Persona for verification purposes.
4. **Manual Review:** Persona's & BSA team conducts a manual review of the uploaded documents to confirm the user's age and identity.
5. **Approved Users:** Once the verification is successful, users will be granted a ID Verified Badge on BrickVerse, if ID Verificaiton restrictions enabled, they will be disabled.

### BrickVerse Safety Administration (BSA) Role

To ensure the smooth operation of GIV and the safety of our platform, BrickVerse Safety Administration (BSA) plays a vital role. As of September 2023, BSA is responsible for handling 500 monthly Government Verification Inquiries (GVI). We limit to 500 verification requests monthly, so expect possible delays.

#### **The Process:**

1. **Request Submission:** Users who require GIV will submit their verification request through the platform.
2. **BSA Review:** BrickVerse Safety Administration receives and reviews these requests. They ensure that the documents submitted are in line with our verification requirements.
3. **Verification Outcome:** BSA will communicate the verification outcome to the user within a reasonable time frame. If the verification is successful, the user's account will be approved for full access.
4. **Ongoing Oversight:** BSA monitors the GIV process to maintain its integrity and accuracy. Any discrepancies or issues are promptly addressed to ensure the security of our platform.

### Privacy and Data Security

Rest assured, BrickVerse.co and Persona take user privacy and data security seriously. Personal information is handled with care, stored securely, and used exclusively for verification purposes.
