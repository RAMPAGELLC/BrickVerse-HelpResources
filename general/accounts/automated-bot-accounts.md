# Automated ("Bot") Accounts

## Introduction

BrickVerse offers users the flexibility to create automated accounts, commonly known as bot accounts, to enhance their gaming experiences, guild management, and other activities on the platform. Bot accounts can be utilized to automate certain tasks, provide interactive features, and facilitate smoother gameplay. Here are some key aspects to consider when creating bot accounts on BrickVerse.

1. Purpose and Functionality: Determine the specific purpose and functionality of your bot account. Are you creating it to automate in-game tasks, provide customer support, or manage guild activities? Clearly define the tasks and interactions you want your bot account to handle to ensure it aligns with your objectives.
2. Account Development: Develop your bot account by leveraging BrickVerse's APIs, modules, and relevant documentation. Familiarize yourself with the available tools and resources that enable you to program the desired features and automate actions. You can use APIs for user interactions, data retrieval, and game mechanics integration, among other functionalities.
3. Responsible Use and Compliance: It's crucial to use bot accounts responsibly and adhere to BrickVerse's terms of service and community guidelines. Ensure that your bot account's actions align with ethical practices and respect the privacy and rights of other users. Avoid engaging in any form of malicious or disruptive behavior. Remember that while bot accounts can enhance user experiences, they should not be used to exploit or harm other users.

It's important to note that while BrickVerse supports the creation of bot accounts, the platform does not endorse or verify these accounts. Unlike verified user accounts, which receive a checkmark to indicate their authenticity, bot accounts are not subject to the verification process. Therefore, users should exercise caution and understand that interactions with bot accounts are based on the intentions and actions set by their creators. Some automated accounts may be given a checkmark at the discretion of the staff team.

## Reporting
