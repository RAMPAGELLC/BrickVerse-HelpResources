# BrickVerse.gg Data Deletion Policy

At BrickVerse.gg, we understand the importance of maintaining a fresh and organized community. To achieve this, we have established rules for automatically deleting specific types of content after a designated period. These automatic data deletion rules are as follows:

1. **User Feed Content**: User feed content, such as posts and updates, is automatically deleted after 90 days from the date of posting.

In this article, we will provide more details on how these rules work and offer some best practices for managing your content within BrickVerse.gg.

### User Feed Content

#### Deletion After 90 Days

User feed content includes posts, updates, etc. you share within your dashboard. To keep the platform clutter-free and ensure the most relevant and up-to-date information is available to users, all user feed content will be automatically deleted 90 days after you post it.

This deletion applies to all content, including text, images, videos, and any other media that you share on your profile.

#### Best Practices

* Regularly review your older posts and updates to decide if they are still relevant or useful. You can manually delete content that is no longer needed.
