# BrickVerse.gg Data Deletion Policy

Welcome to BrickVerse.gg, a dynamic and innovative social platform dedicated to empowering teens and gamers to unleash their creativity and craft captivating gaming experiences. To ensure a safe and clutter-free environment, we have implemented an automatic data deletion policy for certain types of content on our platform.

### Overview

At BrickVerse.gg, we understand the importance of maintaining a fresh and organized community. To achieve this, we have established rules for automatically deleting specific types of content after a designated period. These automatic data deletion rules are as follows:

1. **User Feed Content**: User feed content, such as posts and updates, is automatically deleted after 90 days from the date of posting.
2. **Guild Community Channel Messages**: Messages in Guild community channels are automatically deleted after 6 months unless they are "stickied" by a Guild Moderator.

In this article, we will provide more details on how these rules work and offer some best practices for managing your content within BrickVerse.gg.

### User Feed Content

#### Deletion After 90 Days

User feed content includes posts, updates, etc you share within your dashboard. To keep the platform clutter-free and ensure the most relevant and up-to-date information is available to users, all user feed content will be automatically deleted 90 days after you post it.

This deletion applies to all content, including text, images, videos, and any other media that you share on your profile.

#### Best Practices

* Regularly review your older posts and updates to decide if they are still relevant or useful. You can manually delete content that is no longer needed.

### Guild Community Channel Messages

#### Deletion After 6 Months

Messages posted in Guild community channels are essential for communication, but over time, they can accumulate and clutter the channels. To maintain organized and relevant discussions, all messages in Guild community channels will be automatically deleted after 6 months.

**Exceptions**: Guild Moderators have the ability to "sticky" important messages to prevent them from being automatically deleted. Stickied messages will remain accessible to Guild members indefinitely, until deleted by a Guild Moderator or by a BrickVerse.gg Trust & Safety official.

#### Best Practices

* Guild Moderators should use the "sticky" feature strategically to keep essential announcements and information readily available to Guild members.
* Regularly review your Guild community channels and archive or save important discussions to prevent the loss of valuable information.

We aim to provide a fresh and organized environment for all BrickVerse.gg users. Please keep these guidelines in mind as you engage with the platform and contribute to our vibrant community.&#x20;
