# How to Manage Multiple Devices on BrickVerse.gg

BrickVerse.gg is a dynamic and innovative social platform designed to empower teenagers and provide them with the tools and resources to unleash their creativity and craft captivating gaming experiences.&#x20;

To ensure the security and performance of our platform, we have a limit of five active sessions for all users. This means that if you log in to a new device while already having five active sessions, you will be automatically logged out of all devices and logged into the new one.

In this guide, we will walk you through the steps to manage your devices and ensure a smooth experience on BrickVerse.gg.

### Why Do We Limit Active Sessions?

Limiting active sessions is a security and performance measure designed to protect your account and ensure that only authorized users can access it. By having a maximum of five active sessions, we can prevent unauthorized access and optimize the performance of our platform.

### How to Manage Multiple Devices

1. **Log In to a New Device:** When you log in to a new device, you will be prompted to enter your login credentials, just like you would when logging in for the first time. Once you've successfully entered your username and password, you will be logged into the new device.
2. **Automatic Logout of Other Devices:** To make room for the new device, our system will automatically log you out of all other devices where you were previously logged in. You'll receive a notification via e-mail when this happens.
3. **Accessing Your Account:** You can now access your BrickVerse.gg account on the new device without any issues.

### Managing Your Devices

If you want to manage your devices or ensure that only the devices you trust have access to your BrickVerse.gg account, here are some additional tips:

1. **Log Out from Unused Devices:** To free up slots for new devices, you can manually log out from any device you no longer use. This can be done through the settings on each device by selecting the "Log Out" or "Sign Out" option, or by going to account settings and manually signing out that device.
2. **Change Your Password:** If you believe your account's security has been compromised or want to ensure that you are the only one with access, you can change your password. This will require any unauthorized users to re-enter the new password to access your account.
3. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** For an added layer of security, we recommend enabling 2FA for your BrickVerse.gg account. This will help protect your account even if someone manages to obtain your login credentials.

### Wrapping Up

Managing multiple devices on BrickVerse.gg is simple and secure. Our limit of five active sessions ensures that your account remains protected and that you can enjoy a smooth and uninterrupted experience on our platform. By following these steps, you can easily log in to new devices and keep your account secure. If you have any questions or encounter any issues, please don't hesitate to contact our support team for assistance.
