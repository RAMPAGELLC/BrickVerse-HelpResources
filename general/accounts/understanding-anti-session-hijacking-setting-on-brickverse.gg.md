# Understanding Anti-Session Hijacking Setting on BrickVerse.gg

\
Welcome to BrickVerse.gg, a dynamic and innovative social platform dedicated to empowering teens and gamers to unleash their creativity and craft captivating gaming experiences. We take user security seriously, and one of the key features that enhances your account's security is the "Anti-Session Hijacking" setting. This setting prevents devices on different IP addresses from using your session cookie. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explain how this setting works and why it's essential to safeguard your account.

## Static vs. Dynamic IP Addresses

Before we delve into the Anti-Session Hijacking setting, it's crucial to understand the difference between static and dynamic IP addresses.

* **Static IP**: A static IP address remains the same over time. This means that every time you connect to the internet, your device is assigned the same unique IP address. Static IPs are common for businesses, dedicated servers, and some internet providers.
* **Dynamic IP**: Dynamic IP addresses change periodically. When you connect to the internet, your Internet Service Provider (ISP) assigns you an available IP address from a pool. The IP address you receive can change each time you connect or at regular intervals.

## Anti-Session Hijacking Setting

1. **Purpose**: The Anti-Session Hijacking setting is designed to enhance the security of your BrickVerse.gg account by preventing unauthorized access to your account from devices with different IP addresses.
2. **How It Works**:
   * **Static IP Devices**: If your IP address is static, the Anti-Session Hijacking setting works effectively. It verifies that the incoming requests match the IP address associated with your account, ensuring that only authorized devices can access your account.
   * **Dynamic IP Devices**: For users with dynamic IP addresses, this setting may pose some limitations. Since dynamic IPs change periodically, the system may not recognize your new IP address, leading to session invalidation.
3. **Session Invalidation**: If a user, whether they have a static or dynamic IP, attempts to access your account from a different IP address, your account sessions will be invalidated. This action is taken to prevent any unauthorized access to your account and protect your data.
4. **Email Notifications**: To keep you informed and aware of any suspicious activities, BrickVerse.gg will notify you by email when a session is invalidated due to a mismatched IP address. This gives you the opportunity to take immediate action if you believe your account may be compromised.
