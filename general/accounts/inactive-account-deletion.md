# Inactive Account Deletion

At BrickVerse, we value the security and privacy of our users. To ensure that our platform remains a safe and vibrant community, we have implemented an Inactive Account Deletion policy. This policy is designed to remove accounts that have been inactive for an extended period of time. In this article, we'll explain how this policy works and how you can prevent your account from being deleted.

### Why do we delete inactive accounts?

Inactive accounts can pose a security risk and clutter our platform. To maintain the integrity of our community and to free up resources, we have established a policy to automatically delete accounts that have been inactive for an extended period.

### How the Inactive Account Deletion works

**1. Timeframe:** Accounts that have been inactive for 2 years are subject to deletion.

**2. Warning Emails:** Before your account is deleted, you will receive two warning emails:

* **First Warning:** 48 hours before your account's deletion, you will receive an email informing you of the impending deletion. This email is a precautionary measure to ensure you have ample time to log in and prevent the deletion if you wish to keep your account. Warning will be forwarded to a linked Phone that is verified as well.
* **Second Warning:** 1 hour before your account is set to be deleted, you will receive another email as a final reminder. Warning will be forwarded to a linked Phone that is verified as well.

**3. Preventing Deletion:** If you receive either of these warning emails and wish to retain your account, you can easily prevent its deletion by logging into your account. Logging in, even if you've been inactive for an extended period, this will cancel the deletion process.

### How to keep your account active

To ensure your account remains active and exempt from the Inactive Account Deletion policy, here are some steps you can take:

**1. Regular Login:** Simply logging into your account periodically, even if you don't plan to actively use it, will keep your account active.

**2. Update Your Email:** Ensure that your registered email address is up to date so you receive the warning emails.

**3. Keep Your Profile Information Current:** Keeping your profile information current and accurate is a good practice in general and can also help in keeping your account active.
