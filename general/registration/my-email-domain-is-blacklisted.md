# My Email Domain is Blacklisted?

### Introduction

In BrickVerse, we take email security seriously to protect our users from potential threats and ensure a safe online environment. As part of our security measures, we have implemented a list of allowed email domains. If you encounter an issue where your email domain is blacklisted, this article will guide you through the possible reasons and steps to resolve the problem.

### Possible Reasons for Blacklisting

If you find that your email domain is blacklisted and you cannot use it to register or log in to BrickVerse, there are several possible reasons for this:

1. **Security Concerns**: The email domain might have been associated with security breaches, spamming, or other malicious activities. To ensure the safety of our users, BrickVerse takes proactive measures to block domains with a history of security issues.
2. **Phishing and Scam Prevention**: BrickVerse blacklists email domains that are commonly used for phishing scams or fraudulent activities. This is done to protect our users from potential threats.
3. **Privacy and Compliance**: Certain email domains might not comply with our privacy policies or data protection regulations. To maintain a high level of privacy and security, such domains are added to the blacklist.
4. **Temporary Blacklisting**: In some cases, email domains might be temporarily blacklisted due to ongoing investigations or security reviews. If this is the case, the issue will be resolved once the investigation is complete.

### What to Do If Your Email Domain Is Blacklisted

If you find that your email domain is blacklisted, here are the steps you can take to resolve the issue:

1. **Contact Support**: If you believe that your email domain should not be blacklisted, or if you think it was blacklisted by mistake, please reach out to our support team. They will investigate the matter and assist you in resolving the issue.
2. **Alternative Email**: If your primary email domain is blacklisted, consider using an alternative email address from one of the allowed domains listed above. This way, you can register and access BrickVerse without any issues.
3. **Check for Security Measures**: Ensure that your email account is secure and not associated with any suspicious activities. Regularly update your passwords and enable two-factor authentication (if available) to add an extra layer of security.
