# What's a Beta Key?

BrickVerse.co, the highly anticipated virtual world of creativity and construction, is gearing up for early testing, and access to this immersive experience is limited to those with beta keys. To be one of the fortunate few who can explore this digital realm, individuals have two main avenues: being an employee of BrickVerse or obtaining a beta key. As an employee, one gains automatic access to the beta testing phase, providing an exclusive opportunity to shape the future of the platform. However, for those who aren't employed by BrickVerse, acquiring a beta key is the only other pathway to entry.

For non-employees, the acquisition of a beta key opens the gateway to BrickVerse.co's early testing phase. While beta keys cannot be obtained freely, users have an exciting alternative: purchasing a membership. When users become members of the BrickVerse community, they are granted the privilege to share beta keys with their friends or fellow enthusiasts. This innovative system promotes a sense of camaraderie and collaboration, enabling the eager testers to engage with the platform together and discover its potential as a collective force. So, whether one is part of the BrickVerse team or has access through a beta key shared via membership, the journey into this virtual brick-building wonderland awaits!
