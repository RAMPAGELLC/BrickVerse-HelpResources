# Why Is My Username Blacklisted?

### Reasons for Blacklisted Usernames

When registering a username on BrickVerse, it is essential to adhere to our guidelines to ensure a respectful and secure platform. Usernames are blacklisted for the following reasons:

1. **Violation of Terms of Service or Community Guidelines**: Usernames that contain offensive, harmful, or inappropriate content are strictly prohibited. This includes usernames promoting hate speech, discrimination, violence, or any other behavior that violates our Terms of Service or Community Guidelines.
2. **Protecting Children**: BrickVerse is a family-friendly platform, and as such, we have a responsibility to protect children from potential harm. Usernames that may be misleading or harmful to minors are automatically blacklisted.
3. **Protecting Corporate Brands**: To prevent potential brand misrepresentation or confusion, usernames that closely resemble or impersonate well-known corporate brands are blacklisted. This ensures that legitimate corporate entities are not misrepresented on our platform.
4. **Security Reasons**: Some usernames may be blacklisted as part of our security measures to prevent fraudulent or malicious activities on BrickVerse.

### How Corporate Brands Can Take Over a Blacklisted Username

We understand that legitimate corporate brands may have a valid reason to use a username that has been blacklisted due to its similarity to their brand name. To facilitate this process, we have established a simple procedure for corporate brands to claim a blacklisted username:

1. **Contact BrickVerse Support**: Corporate representatives who wish to take over a blacklisted username can reach out to our support team by visiting brickverse.co/help. Provide relevant information about your brand, including proof of ownership or authorization to act on behalf of the brand.
2. **Verification Process**: Our support team will carefully review the provided information to verify the legitimacy of the request. This step ensures that only genuine corporate brands can claim the blacklisted username.
3. **Transfer of Username**: Once the verification is successful, BrickVerse will transfer the blacklisted username to the authorized corporate representative. The username will be reserved exclusively for the corporate brand's use.

### Corporate Brands and Unblacklisted Usernames

If a corporate brand chooses to register a username that is not blacklisted, they are free to do so following our standard registration process. However, we encourage corporate brands to consider using their official brand names or variations that clearly represent their identity to avoid potential confusion.

### Conclusion

The blacklisting of usernames on BrickVerse is an essential measure to ensure a safe, respectful, and enjoyable experience for all users, particularly children and corporate entities. By preventing the use of inappropriate or misleading usernames, we create a positive online environment for creativity and collaboration.
