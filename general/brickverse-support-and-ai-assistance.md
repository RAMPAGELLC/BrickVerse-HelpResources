# Brickverse Support & AI Assistance

At **Brickverse**, we use AI to help respond to support tickets quickly and accurately — so you can get help without long wait times.

Here’s how it works:

***

#### 🧠 How Our AI Support Works

When you submit a support ticket:

1. **Our AI reviews your message**
   * It analyzes your issue.
   * It searches our help articles and platform documentation.
   * It uses its training on Brickverse systems to provide the most relevant solution.
2. **You receive an automated response**
   * Most common issues are resolved immediately.
   * The AI may ask follow-up questions to clarify your issue.
3. **Escalation Decision**
   * If the AI determines your issue requires human review, it will automatically escalate your ticket.
   * Some complex cases (billing disputes, account security concerns, platform bugs, etc.) are prioritized for human review.

#### 👤 When Does a Human Step In?

There are two ways your ticket can be reviewed by a human agent:

**1️⃣ Automatic Escalation**

If the AI detects that:

* The issue is complex
* The issue involves sensitive account access
* The problem cannot be resolved using available help documentation

Your ticket will be elevated automatically.

**2️⃣ Manual Escalation Request**

If your issue is not resolved and you would prefer a human review:

* You may request escalation **after 24 hours** from your initial ticket submission.
* A human support agent will then review your case.

This system allows us to:

* Resolve simple issues instantly
* Prioritize complex issues efficiently
* Reduce overall response times for everyone

***

#### ⏱ Why 24 Hours?

Our AI resolves the majority of tickets quickly. The 24-hour window ensures:

* The AI has adequate time to troubleshoot.
* Follow-up questions can be answered.
* Human agents can focus on cases that truly require manual review.

***

#### 📚 What the AI Is Trained On

Our AI is trained on:

* Brickverse platform systems
* Official help documentation
* Common troubleshooting patterns
* Historical support resolutions

It does **not** make account changes, process refunds, or take irreversible actions without proper system authorization.

***

#### 💡 Tips for Faster Resolution

To help the AI (and our team) assist you faster:

* Include clear details about the issue
* Provide error messages (copy/paste preferred)
* Include screenshots if applicable
* Mention your universe ID, world ID, or relevant reference numbers

***

#### 🛡️ Privacy & Security

Your support messages are handled securely. AI processing is used strictly to improve resolution speed and accuracy within the Brickverse platform.
