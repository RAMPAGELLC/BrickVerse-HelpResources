# Automatic Moderation and Account Termination on BrickVerse.gg

## Introduction

At BrickVerse.gg, we prioritize the safety and well-being of our community members. To maintain a secure and respectful environment, we utilize automated moderation systems that work in conjunction with our automation provider's findings. These systems are designed to detect and address any violations of our community guidelines swiftly and effectively, including taking actions such as account termination when necessary. In this article, we'll explain how our automated moderation systems work and how they may result in account termination.

1.  **Automated Moderation Systems**

    BrickVerse.gg employs state-of-the-art automated moderation systems to scan and evaluate user-generated content, including but not limited to textures, audio, and videos. These systems are equipped with the capability to analyze and identify a range of guideline violations, such as inappropriate language, hate speech, offensive imagery, and other breaches of our community standards.
2.  **Collaboration with Automation Providers**

    Our automated moderation systems work in collaboration with our trusted automation providers, leveraging their advanced technologies to enhance our moderation capabilities. These providers use cutting-edge algorithms and machine learning models to scan and flag content that is potentially problematic.
3.  **Actions Taken by Automated Systems**

    When our automated moderation systems detect content that violates our community guidelines or terms of service, they can take various actions, including but not limited to:

    1. **Content Removal**: In cases where a texture, audio, video, or other user-generated content is found to be in violation of our guidelines, the automated system may remove or restrict the content to prevent exposure to the community.
4.  **Account Termination**

    In severe cases, where repeated violations or serious breaches of our community guidelines occur, our automated moderation systems, in conjunction with our automation provider's findings, may lead to account termination. Account termination is a last resort action taken to maintain a safe and respectful environment for our community members. It is essential to ensure that those who consistently disrupt the community's well-being are appropriately addressed.
5.  **Reporting and Appeal Process**

    We understand that automated systems may occasionally produce false positives or make mistakes. If you believe your account or content has been wrongly flagged or terminated, we provide a reporting and appeal process to review and rectify any errors. Please contact our support team or use the provided reporting tools for assistance.
