Why Account Closures Happen: Account closures can occur for various reasons, such as a violation of our terms of service, inactivity, or a request made by you. Please review our Terms of Service and Community Guidelines for a detailed understanding of what actions can lead to account closures.

When Will You Receive an Email Notification? You will receive an email notification when the BrickVerse.gg team initiates an account closure or when an account closure request is made by you. Here are the scenarios in which you can expect to receive an email:

1. **Account Closure Request:** If you choose to close your account, we will send you a confirmation email to ensure that the request is intentional. This email will contain instructions on how to proceed.
2. **Violation of Terms of Service:** If your account is closed due to a violation of our terms of service, you will receive an email notification that outlines the reasons for the closure.
3. **Inactivity:** BrickVerse.gg may close inactive accounts. If your account falls into this category, we will send you an email notification before the closure.

What to Expect in the Email Notification: Our account closure email notifications are designed to be clear and informative. They will typically include the following information:

* **Reason for Closure:** We will provide a brief explanation of why your account is being closed, whether it's due to inactivity, a policy violation, or a request from you.
* **Next Steps:** Depending on the reason for closure, the email will contain instructions on what you can do next. For example, if it's an inactivity closure, we may provide details on how to prevent the closure.
* **Contact Information:** You'll find contact information for our support team in case you have questions or concerns about the closure.
* **Appeal Process:** If your account was closed due to a policy violation and you believe it was done in error, we will explain how you can appeal the decision.

1. **Review the Email:** Carefully read the email to understand the reason for the account closure and any instructions provided.
2. **Contact Support:** If you have questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to our support team. They can provide further assistance and guidance.
