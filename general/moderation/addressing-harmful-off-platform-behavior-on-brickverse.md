# Addressing Harmful Off-Platform Behavior on BrickVerse

At BrickVerse, we are dedicated to providing a safe and secure online community for our users. Our commitment to safety extends beyond the boundaries of our platform, and we take a strong stance against harmful off-platform behavior. In this article, we'll outline how we address such behavior through moderation actions to foster a secure and welcoming community.

### What is Harmful Off-Platform Behavior?

Harmful off-platform behavior refers to actions taken by users that occur outside the BrickVerse platform but are associated with their presence on our platform and have the potential to negatively impact the safety and well-being of our community members. Examples of such behavior include cyberbullying, harassment, and hate speech on external websites or social media accounts.

### Our Approach to Addressing Harmful Off-Platform Behavior

BrickVerse takes harmful off-platform behavior seriously, and we have implemented a proactive approach to address such incidents:

**1. Investigation:** When we become aware of or receive credible reports of harmful off-platform behavior by a BrickVerse user, our moderation team will conduct a thorough investigation to gather evidence and assess the situation.

**2. Moderation Action:** Based on the outcome of the investigation and the severity of the behavior, we may take the following moderation actions:

* **Warning:** Users found engaging in harmful off-platform behavior may receive a warning. This serves as a notice to the user to cease such behavior immediately.
* **Muting or Restricting:** In cases of repeated or severe harmful off-platform behavior, we may mute or restrict the user's activity on our platform to prevent further disruptions.
* **Temporary Suspension:** For more serious violations, temporary suspension may be imposed to protect the community from harm. This suspension can range from a few days to several weeks, depending on the severity of the behavior.
* **Permanent Suspension:** In the most severe cases or instances of repeated harmful behavior, BrickVerse reserves the right to permanently suspend a user's account to ensure the safety of the community.

**3. Communication:** We will communicate our moderation actions clearly with the user, explaining the reasons behind the action taken and providing an opportunity for the user to rectify their behavior and comply with our community guidelines.

**4. User Reporting:** We encourage our community members to report instances of harmful off-platform behavior that involve BrickVerse users. Your reports are invaluable in helping us maintain a safe environment.

**5. Privacy and Data Protection:** Rest assured that our investigations and actions adhere to privacy and data protection regulations. We respect the privacy of all involved parties and handle sensitive information with the utmost care.

### Your Role in Building a Safe Community

While BrickVerse takes strong measures to address harmful off-platform behavior, the active involvement of our community members is essential. If you encounter such behavior or are aware of it, please report it to our moderation team promptly. Your cooperation helps us maintain a secure and welcoming community for all.
