# Automatic Account Moderation at BrickVerse.gg

**Introduction:** At BrickVerse.gg, our top priority is to create a nurturing and secure digital space for our community members to express their creativity and connect with like-minded enthusiasts. To ensure the highest standards of online safety and content quality, we have partnered with Microsoft's Azure Content Moderator, an advanced artificial intelligence solution that enables us to implement automatic content moderation on various types of user uploads, including shirts, pants, t-shirts, game textures, game audio, and more. In this comprehensive guide, we will delve deeper into how Microsoft's AI findings empower our automated moderation system, what types of content are strictly prohibited, and the consequences of posting such content on our platform.

**Automatic Account Moderation:** Microsoft's Azure Content Moderator stands as a robust tool in our arsenal, designed to bolster our commitment to a clean and secure online environment. It utilizes AI-driven insights to facilitate automatic account moderation. The key principles governing our automatic moderation system are as follows:

**1. Termination for Prohibited Content:** Accounts found posting content that falls within the categories of Sexual Content, Nudity, Drugs, Child Exploitation, Violence, and Gore will be subject to automatic termination. We maintain a zero-tolerance stance towards such content to protect the integrity and safety of our community.

**2. Reporting to Authorities:** In the case of content that involves Child Exploitation, our actions extend beyond account termination. We automatically report such content to the FBI Field Office in Salem, Oregon, ensuring that it is dealt with in accordance with legal standards, and potential harm is mitigated promptly.

**3. Automatic Deletion:** Any content flagged by Microsoft's AI findings as violating our content guidelines will be automatically deleted. This process ensures that the platform remains pristine and safe for all our users.

**Content Subject to Moderation:** Our automatic moderation system also monitors content that contains alcohol, tobacco, drugs, weapons, profanity, and vulgarity. Although these types of content may not result in immediate account termination, they are subject to varying degrees of moderation, including warnings, restrictions, or temporary suspensions. These measures are in place to foster a positive and inclusive environment for all users and encourage responsible usage of our services. The severity of the moderation is tailored to the specific content and the circumstances surrounding its posting.
