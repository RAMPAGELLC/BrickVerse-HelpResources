# I verified my ID / purchased a membership — where is my achievement badge?

If you recently **verified your ID** or **purchased a BrickVerse membership** but don’t see the achievement badge on your profile yet, don’t worry — this is usually just a session sync issue.

### Why this happens

Achievement badges for **ID Verification** and **Membership** are granted automatically, but your current login session may not refresh immediately after the action is completed. Because of this, your profile might not display the badge right away even though the system has recorded it.

### How to fix it

Simply **log out of your account and log back in**.

Re-logging triggers a session refresh and prompts our system to check for newly earned achievements. Once you sign back in, your badge should appear on your profile.

### Still not showing?

If you’ve logged out and back in and the badge still doesn’t appear after a few minutes:

* Make sure your ID verification fully completed (no pending review)
* Confirm your membership payment went through successfully
* Try clearing your browser cache or using a different browser

If the badge is still missing after trying the steps above, contact BrickVerse Support and include:

* Your username
* The type of badge you’re missing (ID Verified or Membership)
* The date you verified or purchased

We’ll get it sorted for you as quickly as possible.
