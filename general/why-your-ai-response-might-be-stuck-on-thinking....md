Here’s why this happens and what it means.

***

#### ⏳ Deliberate Response Delay

Our AI intentionally takes **1–5 minutes** to generate replies. This ensures:

* The system isn’t overloaded during peak times
* The AI has enough time to process your issue accurately
* Responses are thorough and relevant, not rushed

Think of it as the AI “thinking carefully” before giving you the best answer.

***

#### 🔄 How Context Updates Work

If you send a **new message or update your ticket** while the AI is still thinking:

* **Previous pending replies are canceled**
* This allows the AI to start fresh with your **latest context**
* It prevents the AI from giving outdated or incomplete advice

This ensures the AI always considers your **most recent information**.

***

#### 💡 Tips to Avoid Long Delays

* Avoid sending multiple updates at once—wait for the current reply if possible
* Include all relevant details in your initial message
* Exact error messages help the AI respond faster

***

#### ✅ Summary

“Stuck on thinking…” isn’t a problem—it’s your AI taking the time to:

* Process your ticket without overloading the system
* Include the latest context in its response
* Give the most accurate and helpful guidance

***

With this system, Brickverse ensures that even complex issues get thoughtful attention, while keeping responses efficient and reliable.
